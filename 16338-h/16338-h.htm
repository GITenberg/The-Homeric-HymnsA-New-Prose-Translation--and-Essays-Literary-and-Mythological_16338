<h2>DEDICATION</h2>
<p>To Henry Butcher<br />
A Little Token of<br />
A Long Friendship <!-- page vii--><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span></p>
<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>To translate the Hymns usually called &ldquo;Homeric&rdquo; had long
been my wish, and, at the Publisher&rsquo;s suggestion, I undertook
the work.&nbsp; Though not in partnership, on this occasion, with my
friend, Mr. Henry Butcher (Professor of Greek in the University of Edinburgh),
I have been fortunate in receiving his kind assistance in correcting
the proofs of the longer and most of the minor Hymns.&nbsp; Mr. Burnet,
Professor of Greek in the University of St. Andrews, has also most generously
read the proofs of the translation.&nbsp; It is, of course, to be understood
that these scholars are not responsible for the slips which may have
wandered into my version, <!-- page viii--><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>the
work of one whose Greek has long &ldquo;rusted in disuse.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Indeed I must confess that the rendering &ldquo;Etin&rdquo; for &pi;&epsilon;&lambda;&omega;&rho;
is retained in spite of Mr. Butcher, who is also not wholly satisfied
with &ldquo;gledes of light,&rdquo; and with &ldquo;shieling&rdquo;
for a pastoral summer station in the hills.&nbsp; But I know no word
for it in English south of Tweed.</p>
<p>Mr. A. S. Murray, the Head of the Classical Department in the British
Museum, has also been good enough to read, and suggest corrections in
the preliminary Essays; while Mr. Cecil Smith, of the British Museum,
has obligingly aided in selecting the works of art here reproduced.</p>
<p>The text of the Hymns is well known to be corrupt, in places impossible,
and much mended by conjecture.&nbsp; I have usually followed Gemoll
(<i>Die Homerischen Hymnen</i>, Leipzig, 1886), but have sometimes preferred
a MS. reading, or emendations by Mr. <!-- page ix--><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>Tyrrell,
by Mr. Verral, or the admirable suggestions of Mr. Allen.&nbsp; My chief
object has been to find, in cases of doubt, the phrases least unworthy
of the poets.&nbsp; Too often it is impossible to be certain as to what
they really wrote.</p>
<p>I have had beside me the excellent prose translation by Mr. John
Edgar (Thin, Edinburgh, 1891).&nbsp; As is inevitable, we do not always
agree in the sense of certain phrases, but I am far from claiming superiority
for my own attempts.</p>
<p>The method employed in the Essays, the anthropological method of
interpreting beliefs and rites, is still, of course, on its trial.&nbsp;
What can best be said as to its infirmities, and the dangers of its
abuse, and of system-making in the present state of the evidence, will
be found in Sir Alfred Lyall&rsquo;s &ldquo;Asiatic Studies,&rdquo;
vol. ii. chaps. iii. and iv.&nbsp; Readers inclined to pursue the subject
should read <!-- page x--><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>Mr. L. R.
Farnell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cults of the Greek States&rdquo; (Clarendon Press,
1896), Mr. J. G. Frazer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golden Bough,&rdquo; his &ldquo;Pausanias,&rdquo;
and Mr. Hartland&rsquo;s work on &ldquo;The Myth of Perseus.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These books, it must be observed, are by no means always in agreement
with my own provisional theories. <!-- page 3--><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span></p>
<h2>ESSAYS INTRODUCTORY</h2>
<h3>THE SO-CALLED HOMERIC HYMNS</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The existing collection of the Hymns is of unknown editorship,
unknown date, and unknown purpose,&rdquo; says Baumeister.&nbsp; Why
any man should have collected the little preludes of five or six lines
in length, and of purely conventional character, while he did not copy
out the longer poems to which they probably served as preludes, is a
mystery.&nbsp; The celebrated Wolf, who opened the path which leads
modern Homerologists to such an extraordinary number of divergent theories,
thought rightly that the great Alexandrian critics before the Christian
Era, did not recognise the Hymns as &ldquo;Homeric.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
did not employ the Hymns as illustrations of Homeric problems; though
it is certain that they knew the Hymns, for one collection did <!-- page 4--><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>exist
in the third century B.C. <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4">{4}</a>&nbsp;
Diodorus and Pausanias, later, also cite &ldquo;the poet in the Hymns,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Homer in the Hymns&rdquo;; and the pseudo-Herodotus ascribes
the Hymns to Homer in his Life of that author.&nbsp; Thucydides, in
the Periclean age, regards Homer as the blind Chian minstrel who composed
the Hymn to the Delian Apollo: a good proof of the relative antiquity
of that piece, but not evidence, of course, that our whole collection
was then regarded as Homeric.&nbsp; Baumeister agrees with Wolf that
the brief Hymns were recited by rhapsodists as preludes to the recitation
of Homeric or other cantos.&nbsp; Thus, in Hymn xxxi. 18, the poet says
that he is going on to chant &ldquo;the renowns of men half divine.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Other preludes end with a prayer to the God for luck in the competition
of reciters.</p>
<p>This, then, is the plausible explanation of most of the brief Hymns&mdash;they
were <!-- page 5--><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>preludes to epic
recitations&mdash;but the question as to the long narrative Hymns with
which the collection opens is different.&nbsp; These were themselves
rhapsodies recited at Delphi, at Delos, perhaps in Cyprus (the long
Hymn to Aphrodite), in Athens (as the Hymn to Pan, who was friendly
in the Persian invasion), and so forth.&nbsp; That the Pisistratid&aelig;
organised Homeric recitations at Athens is certain enough, and Baumeister
suspects, in xiv., xxiii., xxx., xxxi., xxxii., the hand of Onomacritus,
the forger of Oracles, that strange accomplice of the Pisistratid&aelig;.&nbsp;
The Hymn to Aphrodite is just such a lay as the Ph&aelig;acian minstrel
sang at the feast of Alcinous, in the hearing of Odysseus.&nbsp; Finally
Baumeister supposes our collection not to have been made by learned
editors, like Aristarchus and Zenodotus, but committed confusedly from
memory to papyrus by some amateur.&nbsp; The conventional attribution
of the Hymns to Homer, in spite of linguistic objections, and of many
allusions to things unknown or unfamiliar in the <!-- page 6--><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Epics,
is merely the result of the tendency to set down &ldquo;masterless&rdquo;
compositions to a well-known name.&nbsp; Anything of epic characteristics
was allotted to the master of Epic.&nbsp; In the same way an unfathered
joke of Lockhart&rsquo;s was attributed to Sydney Smith, and the process
is constantly illustrated in daily conversation.&nbsp; The word &upsilon;&mu;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
hymn, had not originally a religious sense: it merely meant a lay.&nbsp;
Nobody calls the Theocritean idylls on Heracles and the Dioscuri &ldquo;hymns,&rdquo;
but they are quite as much &ldquo;hymns&rdquo; (in our sense) as the
&ldquo;hymn&rdquo; on Aphrodite, or on Hermes.</p>
<p>To the English reader familiar with the Iliad and Odyssey the Hymns
must appear disappointing, if he come to them with an expectation of
discovering merits like those of the immortal epics.&nbsp; He will not
find that they stand to the Iliad as Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ode to the
Nativity&rdquo; stands to &ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is
in the Hymns, in fact, no scope for the epic knowledge of human nature
in every mood and aspect.&nbsp; We are not so <!-- page 7--><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>much
interested in the Homeric Gods as in the Homeric mortals, yet the Hymns
are chiefly concerned not with men, but with Gods and their mythical
adventures.&nbsp; However, the interest of the Hymn to Demeter is perfectly
human, for the Goddess is in sorrow, and is mingling with men.&nbsp;
The Hymn to Aphrodite, too, is Homeric in its grace, and charm, and
divine sense of human limitations, of old age that comes on the fairest,
as Tithonus and Anchises; of death and disease that wait for all.&nbsp;
The life of the Gods is one long holiday; the end of our holiday is
always near at hand.&nbsp; The Hymn to Dionysus, representing him as
a youth in the fulness of beauty, is of a charm which was not attainable,
while early art represented the God as a mature man; but literary art,
in the Homeric age, was in advance of sculpture and painting.&nbsp;
The chief merit of the Delian Hymn is in the concluding description
of the assembled Ionians, happy seafarers like the Ph&aelig;acians in
the morning of the world.&nbsp; The <!-- page 8--><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>confusions
of the Pythian Hymn to Apollo make it less agreeable; and the humour
of the Hymn to Hermes is archaic.&nbsp; All those pieces, however, have
delightfully fresh descriptions of sea and land, of shadowy dells, flowering
meadows, dusky, fragrant caves; of the mountain glades where the wild
beasts fawn in the train of the winsome Goddess; and the high still
peaks where Pan wanders among the nymphs, and the glens where Artemis
drives the deer, and the spacious halls and airy palaces of the Immortals.&nbsp;
The Hymns are fragments of the work of a school which had a great Master
and great traditions: they also illustrate many aspects of Greek religion.</p>
<p>In the essays which follow, the religious aspect of the Hymns is
chiefly dwelt upon: I endeavour to bring out what Greek religion had
of human and sacred, while I try to explain its less majestic features
as no less human: as derived from the earliest attempts at speculation
and at mastering the secrets of the world.&nbsp; In these chapters regions
are <!-- page 9--><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>visited which scholars
have usually neglected or ignored.&nbsp; It may seem strange to seek
the origins of Apollo, and of the renowned Eleusinian Mysteries, in
the tales and rites of the Bora and the Nanga; in the beliefs and practices
of Pawnees and Larrakeah, Yao and Khond.&nbsp; But these tribes, too,
are human, and what they now or lately were, the remote ancestors of
the Greeks must once have been.&nbsp; All races have sought explanations
of their own ritual in the adventures of the Dream Time, the <i>Alcheringa</i>,
when beings of a more potent race, Gods or Heroes, were on earth, and
achieved and endured such things as the rites commemorate.&nbsp; And
the things thus endured and achieved, as I try to show, are everywhere
of much the same nature; whether they are now commemorated by painted
savages in the Bora or the Medicine Dance, or whether they were exhibited
and proclaimed by the Eumolpid&aelig; in a splendid hall, to the pious
of Hellas and of Rome.&nbsp; My attempt may seem audacious, and to many
scholars may even be repugnant; but <!-- page 10--><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>it
is on these lines, I venture to think, that the darker problems of Greek
religion and rite must be approached.&nbsp; They are all survivals,
however fairly draped and adorned by the unique genius of the most divinely
gifted race of mankind.</p>
<p>The method of translation is that adopted by Professor Butcher and
myself in the Odyssey, and by me in a version of Theocritus, as well
as by Mr. Ernest Myers, who preceded us, in his Pindar.&nbsp; That method
has lately been censured and, like all methods, is open to objection.&nbsp;
But I confess that neither criticism nor example has converted me to
the use of modern colloquial English, and I trust that my persistence
in using poetical English words in the translation of Greek poetry will
not greatly offend.&nbsp; I cannot render a speech of Anchises thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you really are merely a mortal, and if a woman
of the normal kind was your mother, while your father (as you lay it
down) was the well-known Otreus, and if you <!-- page 11--><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>come
here all through an undying person, Hermes; and if you are to be known
henceforward as my wife,&mdash;why, then nobody, mortal or immortal,
shall interfere with my intention to take instant advantage of the situation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That kind of speech, though certainly long-winded, may be the manner
in which a contemporary pastoralist would address a Goddess &ldquo;in
a coming on humour.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the situation does not occur in
the prose of our existence, and I must prefer to translate the poet
in a manner more congenial, if less up to date.&nbsp; For one rare word
&ldquo;Etin&rdquo; (&pi;&epsilon;&lambda;&omega;&rho;) I must apologise:
it seems to me to express the vagueness of the unfamiliar monster, and
is old Scots, as in the tale of &ldquo;The Red Etin of Ireland.&rdquo;
<!-- page 12--><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span></p>
<h3>THE HYMN TO APOLLO</h3>
<p>The Hymn to Apollo presents innumerable difficulties, both of text,
which is very corrupt, and as to the whole nature and aim of the composition.&nbsp;
In this version it is divided into two portions, the first dealing with
the birth of Apollo, and the foundation of his shrine in the isle of
Delos; the second concerned with the establishment of his Oracle and
fane at Delphi.&nbsp; The division is made merely to lighten the considerable
strain on the attention of the English reader.&nbsp; I have no pretensions
to decide whether the second portion was by the author of the first,
or is an imitation by another hand, or is contemporary, or a later addition,
or a mere compilation from several sources.&nbsp; The first part seems
to find a natural conclusion, about lines 176-181.&nbsp; The blind singer
(who is <!-- page 13--><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>quoted here
by Thucydides) appears at that point to say farewell to his cherished
Ionian audience.&nbsp; What follows, in our second part, appeals to
hearers interested in the Apollo of Crisa, and of the Delphian temple:
the <i>Pythian</i> Apollo.</p>
<p>According to a highly ingenious, but scarcely persuasive theory of
Mr. Verrall&rsquo;s, this interest is unfriendly. <a name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13">{13}</a>&nbsp;
Our second part is no hymn at all, but a sequel tacked on for political
purposes only: and valuable for these purposes because so tacked on.</p>
<p>From line 207 to the end we have this sequel, the story of Apollo&rsquo;s
dealings as Delphinian, and as Pythian; all this following on detached
fragments of enigmatic character, and containing also (305-355) the
intercalated myth about the birth of Typhaon from Hera&rsquo;s anger.&nbsp;
In the politically inspired sequel there is, according to Mr. Verrall,
no living zeal for the honour of Pytho (Delphi).&nbsp; The threat of
the God to his Cretan ministers, <!-- page 14--><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>&mdash;&ldquo;Beware
of arrogance, or . . . &rdquo;&mdash;must be a prophecy after the event.&nbsp;
Now such an event occurred, early in the sixth century, when the Cris&aelig;ans
were supplanted by the people of the town that had grown up round the
Oracle at Delphi.&nbsp; In them, and in the Oracle under their management,
the poet shows no interest (Mr. Verrall thinks), none in the many mystic
peculiarities of the shrine.&nbsp; It is quite in contradiction with
Delphian tradition to represent, as the Hymn does, Trophonius and Agamedes
as the <i>original</i> builders.</p>
<p>Many other points are noted&mdash;such as the derivation of &ldquo;Pytho&rdquo;
from a word meaning <i>rot</i>,&mdash;to show that the hymnist was rather
disparaging than celebrating the Delphian sanctuary.&nbsp; Taking the
Hymn as a whole, more is done for Delos in three lines, says Mr. Verrall,
than for Pytho or Delphi in three hundred.&nbsp; As a whole, the spirit
of the piece is much more Delian (Ionian) than Delphic.&nbsp; So Mr.
Verrall regards the <i>Cento</i> as &ldquo;a religious pasquinade against
the sanctuary on <!-- page 15--><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Parnassus,&rdquo;
a pasquinade emanating from Athens, under the Pisistratid&aelig;, who,
being Ionian leaders, had a grudge against &ldquo;the Dorian Delphi,&rdquo;
&ldquo;a comparatively modern, unlucky, and from the first unsatisfactory&rdquo;
institution.&nbsp; Athenians are interested in the &ldquo;far-seen&rdquo;
altar of the seaman&rsquo;s Dolphin God on the shore, rather than in
his inland Pythian habitation.</p>
<p>All this, with much more, is decidedly ingenious.&nbsp; If accepted
it might lead the way to a general attack on the epics, as <i>tendenz</i>
pieces, works with a political purpose, or doctored for a political
purpose.&nbsp; But how are we to understand the uses of the pasquinade
Hymn?&nbsp; Was it published, so to speak, to amuse and aid the Pisistratid&aelig;?&nbsp;
Does such remote antiquity show us any examples of such handling of
sacred things in poetry?&nbsp; Might we not argue that Apollo&rsquo;s
threat to the Cris&aelig;ans was meant by the poet as a friendly warning,
and is prior to the fall of Crisa?&nbsp; One is reminded of the futile
ingenuity with which German critics, following <!-- page 16--><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>their
favourite method, have analysed the fatal Casket Letters of Mary Stuart
into letters to her husband, Darnley; or to Murray; or by Darnley to
Mary, with scraps of her diary, and false interpolations.&nbsp; The
enemies of the Queen, coming into possession of her papers after the
affair of Carberry Hill, falsified the Casket Letters into their present
appearance of unity.&nbsp; Of course historical facts make this ingenuity
unavailing.&nbsp; We regret the circumstance in the interest of the
Queen&rsquo;s reputation, but welcome these illustrative examples of
what can be done in Germany. <a name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a">{16a}</a></p>
<p>Fortunately all Teutons are not so ingenious.&nbsp; Baumeister has
fallen on those who, in place of two hymns, Delian and Pythian, to Apollo,
offer us half-a-dozen fragments.&nbsp; By presenting an array of discordant
conjectures as to the number and nature of these scraps, he demonstrates
the purely wilful and arbitrary nature of the critical method employed.
<a name="citation16b"></a><a href="#footnote16b">{16b}</a>&nbsp; Thus
one learned person believes <!-- page 17--><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>in
(1) two perfect little poems; (2) two larger hymns; (3) three lacerated
fragments of hymns, one lacking its beginning, the other wofully deprived
of its end.&nbsp; Another <i>savant</i> detects no less than eight fragments,
with interpolations; though perhaps no biblical critic <i>ejusdem farin&aelig;</i>
has yet detected eight Isaiahs.&nbsp; There are about ten other theories
of similar plausibility and value.&nbsp; Meanwhile Baumeister argues
that the Pythian Hymn (our second part) is an imitation of the Delian;
by a follower, not of Homer, but of Hesiod.&nbsp; Thus, the Hesiodic
school was closely connected with Delphi; the Homeric with Ionia, so
that Delphi rarely occurs in the Epics; in fact only thrice (&Iota;.
405, &theta;. 80, &lambda;. 581).&nbsp; The local knowledge is accurate
(Pythian Hymn, 103 <i>sqq</i>.).&nbsp; These are local legends, and
knowledge of the curious chariot ritual of Onchestus.&nbsp; The Muses
are united with the Graces as in a work of art in the Delphian temple.&nbsp;
The poet chooses the Hesiodic and un-Homeric myth of Heaven and Earth,
and their progeny: a myth current also in <!-- page 18--><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Polynesia,
Australia, and New Zealand.&nbsp; The poet is full of inquiry as to
origins, even etymological, as is Hesiod.&nbsp; Like Hesiod (and Mr.
Max Muller), <i>origines rerum ex nominibus explicat</i>.&nbsp; Finally,
the second poet (and here every one must agree) is a much worse poet
than the first.&nbsp; As for the prophetic word of warning to the Cris&aelig;ans
and its fulfilment, Baumeister urges that the people of Cirrha, the
seaport, not of Crisa, were punished, in Olympiad 47 (Grote, ii. 374).</p>
<p>Turning to Gemoll, we find him maintaining that the two parts were
in ancient times regarded as one hymn in the age of Aristophanes. <a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18">{18}</a>&nbsp;
If so, we can only reply, if we agree with Baumeister, that in the age
of Aristophanes, or earlier, there was a plentiful lack of critical
discrimination.&nbsp; As to Baumeister&rsquo;s theory that the second
part is Hesiodic, Gemoll finds a Hesiodic reminiscence in the first
part (line 121), while there are Homeric reminiscences in the second
part. <!-- page 19--><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span></p>
<p>Thus do the learned differ among themselves, and an ordinary reader
feels tempted to rely on his own literary taste.</p>
<p>According to that criterion, I think we probably have in the Hymn
the work of a good poet, in the early part; and in the latter part,
or second Hymn, the work of a bad poet, selecting unmanageable passages
of myth, and handling them pedantically and ill.&nbsp; At all events
we have here work visibly third rate, which cannot be said, in my poor
opinion, about the immense mass of the Iliad and Odyssey.&nbsp; The
great Alexandrian critics did not use the Hymns as illustrative material
in their discussion of Homer.&nbsp; Their instinct was correct, and
we must not start the consideration of the Homeric question from these
much neglected pieces.&nbsp; We must not study <i>obscurum per obscurius</i>.&nbsp;
The genius of the Epic soars high above such myths as those about Pytho,
Typhaon, and the Apollo who is alternately a dolphin and a meteor: soars
high above pedantry and bad etymology.&nbsp; In the Epics we breathe
a purer air. <!-- page 20--><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span></p>
<p>Descending, as it did, from the mythology of savages, the mythic
store of Greece was rich in legends such as we find among the lowest
races.&nbsp; Homer usually ignores them: Hesiod and the authors of the
Hymns are less noble in their selections.</p>
<p>For this reason and for many others, we regard the Hymns, on the
whole, as post-Homeric, while their collector, by inserting the Hymn
to Ares, shows little proof of discrimination.&nbsp; Only the methods
of modern German scholars, such as Wilamowitz M&ouml;llendorf, and of
Englishmen like Mr. Walter Leaf, can find in the Epics marks of such
confusion, dislocation, and interpolations as confront us in the Hymn
to Apollo.&nbsp; (I may refer to my work, &ldquo;Homer and the Epic,&rdquo;
for a defence of the unity of Iliad and Odyssey.)&nbsp; For example,
Mr. Verrall certainly makes it highly probable that the Pythian Hymn,
at least in its concluding words of the God, is not earlier than the
sixth century.&nbsp; But no proof of anything <!-- page 21--><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>like
this force is brought against the antiquity of the Iliad or Odyssey.</p>
<p>As to the myths in the Hymns, I would naturally study them from the
standpoint of anthropology, and in the light of comparison of the legends
of much more backward peoples than the Greeks.&nbsp; But that light
at present is for me broken and confused.</p>
<p>I have been led to conclusions varying from those of such students
as Mr. Tylor and Mr. Spencer, and these conclusions should be stated,
before they are applied to the Myth of Apollo.&nbsp; I am not inclined,
like them, to accept &ldquo;Animism,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Ghost Theory,&rdquo;
as the master-key to the <i>origin</i> of religion, though Animism is
a great tributary stream.&nbsp; To myself it now appears that among
the lowest known races we find present a fluid mass of beliefs both
high and low, from the belief in a moral creative being, a judge of
men, to the pettiest fable which envisages him as a medicine-man, or
even as a beast or bird.&nbsp; In my opinion the higher belief may very
well be <!-- page 22--><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>the earlier.&nbsp;
While I can discern the processes by which the lower myths were evolved,
and were attached to a worthier pre-existing creed, I cannot see how,
if the lower faiths came first, the higher faith was ever evolved out
of <i>them</i> by very backward savages.</p>
<p>On the other side, in the case of Australia, Mr. Tylor writes: &ldquo;For
a long time after Captain Cook&rsquo;s visit, the information as to
native religious ideas is of the scantiest.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was inevitable,
for our information has only been obtained with the utmost difficulty,
and under promises of secrecy, by later inquirers who had entirely won
the confidence of the natives, and had been initiated into their Mysteries.&nbsp;
Mr. Tylor goes on in the same sentence: &ldquo;But, since the period
of European colonists and missionaries, a crowd of alleged native names
for the Supreme Deity and a great Evil Deity have been recorded, which,
if really of native origin, would show the despised black fellow as
in possession of theological generalisations as to the formation and
conservation of the <!-- page 23--><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>universe,
and the nature of good and evil, comparable with those of his white
supplanter in the land.&rdquo; <a name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a">{23a}</a>&nbsp;
Mr. Tylor then proceeds to argue that these ideas have been borrowed
from missionaries.&nbsp; I have tried to reply to this argument by proving,
for example, that the name of Baiame, one of these deities, could not
have been borrowed (as Mr. Tylor seems inclined to hold) from a missionary
tract published sixteen years after we first hear of Baiame, who, again,
was certainly dominant before the arrival of missionaries.&nbsp; I have
adduced other arguments of the same tendency, and I will add that the
earliest English explorers and missionaries in Virginia and New England
(1586-1622) report from America beliefs absolutely parallel in many
ways to the creeds now reported from Australia.&nbsp; Among these notions
are &ldquo;ideas of moral judgment and retribution after death,&rdquo;
which in Australia Mr. Tylor marks as &ldquo;imported.&rdquo; <a name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b">{23b}</a>&nbsp;
In my opinion the <!-- page 24--><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>certainty
that the beliefs in America were not imported, is another strong argument
for their native character, when they are found with such striking resemblances
among the very undeveloped savages of Australia.</p>
<p>Savages, Mr. Hartland says in a censure of my theory, are &ldquo;guiltless&rdquo;
of Christian teaching. <a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24">{24}</a>&nbsp;
If Mr. Hartland is right, Mr. Tylor is wrong; the ideas, whatever else
they are, are unimported, yet, <i>teste</i> Mr. Tylor, the ideas are
comparable with those of the black man&rsquo;s white supplanters.&nbsp;
I would scarcely go so far.&nbsp; If we take, however, the best ideas
attributed to the blacks, and hold them disengaged from the accretion
of puerile fables with which they are overrun, then there are discovered
notions of high religious value, undeniably analogous to some Christian
dogmas.&nbsp; But the sanction of the Australian gods is as powerfully
lent to silly, or cruel, or needless ritual, as to some moral ideas
of weight and merit.&nbsp; In brief, as far as I am able <!-- page 25--><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>to
see, all sorts of ideas, the lowest and the highest, are held at once
confusedly by savages, and the same confusion survives in ancient Greek
belief.&nbsp; As far back as we can trace him, man had a wealth of religious
and mythical conceptions to choose from, and different peoples, as they
advanced in civilisation, gave special prominence to different elements
in the primal stock of beliefs.&nbsp; The choice of Israel was unique:
Greece retained far more of the lower ancient ideas, but gave to them
a beauty of grace and form which is found among no other race.</p>
<p>If this view be admitted for the moment, and for the argument&rsquo;s
sake, we may ask how it applies to the myths of Apollo.&nbsp; Among
the ideas which even now prevail among the backward peoples still in
the neolithic stage of culture, we may select a few conceptions.&nbsp;
There is the conception of a great primal anthropomorphic Being, who
was in the beginning, or, at least, about whose beginning legend is
silent.&nbsp; He made all things, he <!-- page 26--><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>existed
on earth (in some cases), teaching men the arts of life and rules of
conduct, social and moral.&nbsp; In those instances he retired from
earth, and now dwells on high, still concerned with the behaviour of
the tribes.</p>
<p>This is a lofty conception, but it is entangled with a different
set of legends.&nbsp; This primal Being is mixed up with strange persons
of a race earlier than man, half human, half bestial.&nbsp; Many things,
in some cases almost all things, are mythically regarded, not as created,
but as the results of adventures and metamorphoses among the members
of this original race.&nbsp; Now in New Zealand, Polynesia, Greece,
and elsewhere, but not, to my knowledge, in the very most backward peoples,
the place of this original race, &ldquo;Old, old Ones,&rdquo; is filled
by great natural objects, Earth, Sky, Sea, Forests, regarded as beings
of human parts and passions.</p>
<p>The present universe is mythically arranged in regard to their early
adventures: the separation of sky and earth, and so forth. <!-- page 27--><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>
Where this belief prevails we find little or no trace of the primal
maker and master, though we do find strange early metaphysics of curiously
abstract quality (Maoris, Zu&ntilde;is, Polynesians).&nbsp; As far as
our knowledge goes, Greek mythology springs partly from this stratum
of barbaric as opposed to strictly savage thought.&nbsp; Ouranos and
Gaea, Cronos, and the Titans represent the primal beings who have their
counterpart in Maori and Wintu legend.&nbsp; But these, in the Greece
of the Epics and Hesiod, have long been subordinated to Zeus and the
Olympians, who are envisaged as triumphant gods of a younger generation.&nbsp;
There is no Creator; but Zeus&mdash;how, we do not know&mdash;has come
to be regarded as a Being relatively Supreme, and as, on occasion, the
guardian of morality.&nbsp; Of course his conduct, in myth, is represented
as a constant violation of the very rules of life which he expects mankind
to observe.&nbsp; I am disposed to look on this essential contradiction
as the result of a series of mythical accretions on an original conception
of Zeus <!-- page 28--><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>in his higher
capacity.&nbsp; We can see how the accretions arose.&nbsp; Man never
lived consistently on the level of his best original ideas: savages
also have endless myths of Baiame or Daramulun, or Bunjil, in which
these personages, though interested in human behaviour, are puerile,
cruel, absurd, lustful, and so on.&nbsp; Man will sport thus with his
noblest intuitions.</p>
<p>In the same way, in Christian Europe, we may contrast Dunbar&rsquo;s
pious &ldquo;Ballat of Our Lady&rdquo; with his &ldquo;Kynd Kittok,&rdquo;
in which God has his eye on the soul of an intemperate ale-wife who
has crept into Paradise.&nbsp; &ldquo;God lukit, and saw her lattin
in, and leugh His heart sair.&rdquo;&nbsp; Examples of this kind of
sportive irreverence are common enough; their root is in human nature:
and they could not be absent in the mythology of savage or of ancient
peoples.&nbsp; To Zeus the myths of this kind would come to be attached
in several ways.</p>
<p>As a nature-god of the Heaven he marries the Earth.&nbsp; The tendency
of men being to <!-- page 29--><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>claim
descent from a God, for each family with this claim a myth of a separate
divine amour was needed.&nbsp; Where there had existed Totemism, or
belief in kinship with beasts, the myth of the amour of a wolf, bull,
serpent, swan, and so forth, was attached to the legend of Zeus.&nbsp;
Zeus had been that swan, serpent, wolf, or bull.&nbsp; Once more, ritual
arose, in great part, from the rites of sympathetic magic.</p>
<p>This or that mummery was enacted by men for a magical purpose, to
secure success in the chase, agriculture, or war.&nbsp; When the performers
asked, &ldquo;Why do we do thus and thus?&rdquo; the answer was, &ldquo;Zeus
first did so,&rdquo; or Demeter, or Apollo did so, on a certain occasion.&nbsp;
About that occasion a myth was framed, and finally there was no profligacy,
cruelty, or absurdity of which the God was not guilty.&nbsp; Yet, all
the time, he punished adultery, inhospitality, perjury, incest, cannibalism,
and other excesses, of which, in legend, he was always setting the example.&nbsp;
We know from Xenophanes, Plato, <!-- page 30--><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>and
St. Augustine how men&rsquo;s consciences were tormented by this unceasing
contradiction: this overgrowth of myth on the stock of an idea originally
noble.&nbsp; It is thus that I would attempt to account for the contradictory
conceptions of Zeus, for example.</p>
<p>As to Apollo, I do not think that mythologists determined to find,
in Apollo, some deified aspect of Nature, have laid stress enough on
his counterparts in savage myth.&nbsp; We constantly find, in America,
in the Andaman Isles, and in Australia, that, subordinate to the primal
Being, there exists another who enters into much closer relations with
mankind.&nbsp; He is often concerned with healing and with prophecy,
or with the inspiration of conjurers or shamans.&nbsp; Sometimes he
is merely an underling, as in the case of the Massachusetts Kiehtan,
and his more familiar subordinate, Hobamoc. <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30">{30}</a>&nbsp;
But frequently this go-between of God and Man is (like Apollo) the <i>Son</i>
of the primal Being (often an unbegotten Son) or his Messenger <!-- page 31--><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>(Andaman,
Noongaburrah, Kurnai, Kamilaroi, and other Australian tribes).&nbsp;
He reports to the somewhat otiose primal Being about men&rsquo;s conduct,
and he sometimes superintends the Mysteries.&nbsp; I am disposed to
regard the prophetic and oracular Apollo (who, as the Hymn to Hermes
tells us, alone knows the will of Father Zeus) as the Greek modification
of this personage in savage theology.&nbsp; Where this Son is found
in Australia, I by no means regard him as a savage refraction from Christian
teaching about a mediator, for Christian teaching, in fact, has not
been accepted, least of all by the highly conservative sorcerers, or
shamans, or wirreenuns of the tribes.&nbsp; European observers, of course,
have been struck by (and have probably exaggerated in some instances)
the Christian analogy.&nbsp; But if they had been as well acquainted
with ancient Greek as with Christian theology they would have remarked
that the Andaman, American, and Australian &ldquo;mediators&rdquo; are
infinitely more akin to Apollo, in his relations with Zeus <!-- page 32--><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>and
with men, than to any Person about whom missionaries can preach.&nbsp;
But the most devoted believer in borrowing will not say that, when the
Australian mediator, Tundun, son of Mungun-gnaur, turns into a porpoise,
the Kurnai have borrowed from our Hymn of the Dolphin Apollo.&nbsp;
It is absurd to maintain that the Son of the God, the go-between of
God and men, in savage theology, is borrowed from missionaries, while
this being has so much more in common with Apollo (from whom he cannot
conceivably be borrowed) than with Christ.&nbsp; The Tundun-porpoise
story seems to have arisen in gratitude to the porpoise, which drives
fishes inshore, for the natives to catch.&nbsp; Neither Tharamulun nor
Hobamoc (Australian and American Gods of healing and soothsaying), who
appear to men as serpents, are borrowed from Asclepius, or from the
Python of Apollo.&nbsp; The processes have been quite different, and
in Apollo, the oracular son of Zeus, who declares his counsel to men,
I am apt to see a beautiful Greek modification of <!-- page 33--><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>the
type of the mediating Son of the primal Being of savage belief, adorned
with many of the attributes of the Sun God, from whom, however, he is
fundamentally distinct.&nbsp; Apollo, I think, is an adorned survival
of the Son of the God of savage theology.&nbsp; He was not, at first,
a Nature God, solar or not.&nbsp; This opinion, if it seems valid, helps
to account, in part, for the animal metamorphoses of Apollo, a survival
from the mental confusion of savagery.&nbsp; Such a confusion, in Greece,
makes it necessary for the wise son of Zeus to seek information, as
in the Hymn to Hermes, from an old clown.&nbsp; This medley of ideas,
in the mind of a civilised poet, who believes that Apollo is all-knowing
in the counsels of eternity, is as truly mythological as Dunbar&rsquo;s
God who laughs his heart sore at an ale-house jest.&nbsp; Dunbar, and
the author of the Hymn, and the savage with his tale of Tundun or Daramulun,
have all quite contradictory sets of ideas alternately present to their
minds; the medi&aelig;val poet, of course, being conscious of the contradiction,
which <!-- page 34--><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>makes the essence
of his humour, such as it is.&nbsp; To Greece, in its loftier moods,
Apollo was, despite his myth, a noble source of inspiration, of art,
and of conduct.&nbsp; But the contradiction in the low myth and high
doctrine of Apollo, could never be eradicated under any influence less
potent than that of Christianity. <a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34">{34}</a>&nbsp;
If this theory of Apollo&rsquo;s origin be correct, many pages of learned
works on Mythology need to be rewritten. <!-- page 35--><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span></p>
<h2>THE HYMN TO HERMES</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/lang35b.jpg">
<img alt="Hermes with the boy Dionysos.  Statue by Praxiteles, found at Olympia" src="images/lang35s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Hymn to Hermes is remarkable for the corruption of the text,
which appears even to present <i>lacun&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; The English
reader will naturally prefer the lively and charming version of Shelley
to any other.&nbsp; The poet can tell and adorn the story without visibly
floundering in the pitfalls of a dislocated text.&nbsp; If we may judge
by line 51, and if Greek musical tradition be correct, the date of the
Hymn cannot be earlier than the fortieth Olympiad.&nbsp; About that
period Terpander is said to have given the lyre seven strings (as Mercury
does in the poem), in place of the previous four strings.&nbsp; The
date of Terpander is dubious, but probably the seven-stringed lyre had
long been in common use before the poet attributed the invention to
Hermes.&nbsp; The same argument applies to the antiquity <!-- page 36--><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>of
writing, assigned by poets as the invention of various mythical and
prehistoric heroes.&nbsp; But the poets were not careful arch&aelig;ologists,
and regarded anachronisms as genially as did Shakespeare or Scott.&nbsp;
Moreover, the fact that Terpander did invent the seven chords is not
beyond dispute historically, while, mythically, Apollo and Amphion are
credited with the idea.&nbsp; That Hermes invented fire-sticks seems
a fable which robs Prometheus of the honour.&nbsp; We must not look
for any kind of consistency in myth.</p>
<p>The learned differ as to the precise purpose of the Hymn, and some
even exclude the invention of the <i>cithara</i>.&nbsp; To myself it
seems that the poet chiefly revels in a very familiar subject of savage
humour (notably among the Zulus), the extraordinary feats and tricks
of a tiny and apparently feeble and helpless person or animal, such
as Brer Rabbit.&nbsp; The triumph of astuteness over strength (a triumph
here assigned to the infancy of a God) is the theme.&nbsp; Hermes is
here a rustic <i>doublure</i> of Apollo, as he was, in fact, mainly
a rural <!-- page 37--><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>deity, though
he became the Messenger of the Gods, and the Guide of Souls outworn.&nbsp;
In these respects he answers to the Australian Grogoragally, in his
double relation to the Father, Boyma, and to men living and dead. <a name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a">{37a}</a></p>
<p>As a go-between of Gods and men, Hermes may be a <i>doublure</i>
of Apollo, but, as the Hymn shows, he aspired in vain to Apollo&rsquo;s
oracular function.&nbsp; In one respect his behaviour has a singular
savage parallel.&nbsp; His shoes woven of twigs, so as not to show the
direction in which he is proceeding, answer to the equally shapeless
feather sandals of the blacks who &ldquo;go <i>Kurdaitcha</i>,&rdquo;
that is, as avengers of blood.&nbsp; I have nowhere else found this
practice as to the shoes, which, after all, cannot conceal the direction
of the spoor from a native tracker. <a name="citation37b"></a><a href="#footnote37b">{37b}</a>&nbsp;
The trick of driving the cattle backwards answers to the old legend
that Bruce reversed the shoes of <!-- page 38--><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>his
horse when he fled from the court of Edward I.</p>
<p>The humour of the Hymn is rather rustic: cattle theft is the chief
joke, cattle theft by a baby.&nbsp; The God, divine as he is, feels
his mouth water for roast beef, a primitive conception.&nbsp; In fact,
throughout this Hymn we are far from the solemn regard paid to Apollo,
from the wistful beauty of the Hymn to Demeter, and from the gladness
and melancholy of the Hymn to Aphrodite.&nbsp; Sportive myths are treated
sportively, as in the story of Ares and Aphrodite in the Odyssey.&nbsp;
Myths contained all conceivable elements, among others that of humour,
to which the poet here abandons himself.&nbsp; The statues and symbols
of Hermes were inviolably sacred; as Guide of Souls he played the part
of comforter and friend: he brought men all things lucky and fortunate:
he made the cattle bring forth abundantly: he had the golden wand of
wealth.&nbsp; But he was also tricksy as a Brownie or as Puck; and that
fairy aspect of his character and legend, he <!-- page 39--><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>being
the midnight thief whose maraudings account for the unexplained disappearances
of things, is the chief topic of the gay and reckless hymn.&nbsp; Even
the Gods, even angry Apollo, are moved to laughter, for over sport and
playfulness, too, Greek religion throws her sanction.&nbsp; At the dishonesties
of commerce (clearly regarded as a form of theft) Hermes winks his laughing
eyes (line 516).&nbsp; This is not an early Socialistic protest against
&ldquo;Commercialism.&rdquo;&nbsp; The early traders, like the Vikings,
were alternately pirates and hucksters, as opportunity served.&nbsp;
Every occupation must have its heavenly patron, its departmental deity,
and Hermes protects thieves and raiders, &ldquo;minions of the moon,&rdquo;
&ldquo;clerks of St. Nicholas.&rdquo;&nbsp; His very birth is a stolen
thing, the darkling fruit of a divine amour in a dusky cavern.&nbsp;

<h2>THE HYMN TO APHRODITE</h2>
<p>The Hymn to Aphrodite is, in a literary sense, one of the most beautiful
and quite the most Homeric in the collection.&nbsp; By &ldquo;Homeric&rdquo;
I mean that if we found the adventure of Anchises occurring at length
in the Iliad, by way of an episode, perhaps in a speech of &AElig;neas,
it would not strike us as inconsistent in tone, though occasionally
in phrase.&nbsp; Indeed the germ of the Hymn occurs in Iliad, B. 820:
&ldquo;&AElig;neas, whom holy Aphrodite bore to the embraces of Anchises
on the knowes of Ida, a Goddess couching with a mortal.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Again, in E. 313, &AElig;neas is spoken of as the son of Aphrodite and
the neat-herd, Anchises.&nbsp; The celebrated prophecy of the future
rule of the children of &AElig;neas over the Trojans (&Upsilon;. 307),
probably made, like many prophecies, after the <!-- page 41--><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>event,
appears to indicate the claim of a Royal House at Ilios, and is regarded
as of later date than the general context of the epic.&nbsp; The &AElig;neid
is constructed on this hint; the Romans claiming to be of Trojan descent
through &AElig;neas.&nbsp; The date of the composition cannot be fixed
from considerations of the Homeric tone; thus lines 238-239 may be a
reminiscence of Odyssey, &lambda;. 394, and other like suggestions are
offered. <a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41">{41}</a>&nbsp;
The conjectures as to date vary from the time of Homer to that of the
<i>Cypria</i>, of Mimnermus (the references to the bitterness of loveless
old age are in his vein) of Anacreon, or even of Herodotus and the Tragedians.&nbsp;
The words &sigma;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&nu;&eta;, &pi;&rho;&epsilon;&sigma;&beta;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&alpha;,
and other indications are relied on for a late date: and there are obvious
coincidences with the Hymn to Demeter, as in line 174, <i>Demeter</i>
109, f.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gemoll, however, takes this hymn to be the earlier.</p>
<p>About the place of composition, Cyprus or Asia Minor, the learned
are no less divided <!-- page 42--><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>than
about the date.&nbsp; Many of the grounds on which their opinions rest
appear unstable.&nbsp; The relations of Aphrodite to the wild beasts
under her wondrous spell, for instance, need not be borrowed from Circe
with her attendant beasts.&nbsp; If not of Homer&rsquo;s age, the Hymn
is markedly successful as a continuation of the Homeric tone and manner.</p>
<p>Modern Puritanism naturally &ldquo;condemns&rdquo; Aphrodite, as
it &ldquo;condemns&rdquo; Helen.&nbsp; But Homer is lenient; Helen is
under the spell of the Gods, an unwilling and repentant tool of Destiny;
and Aphrodite, too, is driven by Zeus into the arms of a mortal.&nbsp;
She is &alpha;&iota;&delta;&omicron;&iota;&eta;, shamefast; and her
adventure is to her a bitter sorrow (199, 200).&nbsp; The dread of Anchises&mdash;a
man is not long of life who lies with a Goddess&mdash;refers to a belief
found from Glenfinlas to Samoa and New Caledonia, that the embraces
of the spiritual ladies of the woodlands are fatal to men.&nbsp; The
legend has been told to me in the Highlands, and to Mr. Stevenson in
Samoa, while my cousin, <!-- page 43--><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Mr.
J. J. Atkinson, actually knew a Kaneka who died in three days after
an amour like that of Anchises.&nbsp; The Breton ballad, <i>Le Sieur
Nan</i>, turns on the same opinion.&nbsp; The amour of Thomas the Rhymer
is a medi&aelig;val analogue of the Id&aelig;an legend.</p>
<p>Aphrodite has better claims than most Greek Gods to Oriental elements.&nbsp;
Herodotus and Pausanias (i. xiv. 6, iii. 23, I) look on her as a being
first worshipped by the Assyrians, then by the Paphians of Cyprus, and
Ph&oelig;nicians at Askelon, who communicated the cult to the Cythereans.&nbsp;
Cyprus is one of her most ancient sites, and Ishtar and Ashtoreth are
among her Oriental analogues.&nbsp; She springs from the sea&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The wandering waters knew her, the winds and the
viewless ways,<br />
And the roses grew rosier, and bluer the sea-blue streams of the bays.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the charm of Aphrodite is Greek.&nbsp; Even without foreign influence,
Greek polytheism would have developed a Goddess of Love, as did the
polytheism of the North (Frigga) and <!-- page 44--><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>of
the Aztecs.&nbsp; The rites of Adonis, the vernal year, are, even in
the name of the hero, Oriental.&nbsp; &ldquo;The name Adonis is the
Ph&oelig;nician <i>Adon</i>, &lsquo;Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44">{44}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;The decay and revival of vegetation&rdquo; inspires the Adonis
rite, which is un-Homeric; and was superfluous, where the descent and
return of Persephone typified the same class of ideas.&nbsp; To whatever
extent contaminated by Ph&oelig;nician influence, Aphrodite in Homer
is purely Greek, in grace and happy humanity.</p>
<p>The origins of Aphrodite, unlike the origins of Apollo, cannot be
found in a state of low savagery.&nbsp; She is a departmental Goddess,
and as such, as ruling a province of human passion, she belongs to a
late development of religion.&nbsp; To Christianity she was a scandal,
one of the scandals which are absent from the most primitive of surviving
creeds.&nbsp; Polytheism, as if of set purpose, puts every conceivable
aspect of life, good or bad, under divine sanction.&nbsp; This is much
less the case <!-- page 45--><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>in the
religion of the very backward races.&nbsp; We do not know historically,
what the germs of religion were; if we look at the most archaic examples,
for instance in Australia or the Andaman Islands, we find neither sacrifice
nor departmental deities.</p>
<p>Religion there is mainly a belief in a primal Being, not necessarily
conceived as spiritual, but rather as an undying magnified Man, of indefinitely
extensive powers.&nbsp; He dwells above &ldquo;the vaulted sky beyond
which lies the mysterious home of that great and powerful Being, who
is Bunjil, Baiame, or Daramulun in different tribal languages, but who
in all is known by a name the equivalent of the only one used by the
Kurnai, which is Mungan-ngaur, or &lsquo;Our Father.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45">{45}</a>&nbsp;
This Father is conceived of in some places as &ldquo;a very great old
man with a long beard,&rdquo; enthroned on, or growing into, a crystal
throne.&nbsp; Often he is served by a son or sons (Apollo, Hermes),
frequently regarded as spiritually begotten; elsewhere, looked on as
the son of the wife <!-- page 46--><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>of
the deity, and as father of the tribe. <a name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a">{46a}</a>&nbsp;
Scandals connected with fatherhood, amorous intrigues so abundant in
Greek mythology, are usually not reported among the lowest races.&nbsp;
In one known case, the deity, Pundjel or Bunjil, takes the wives of
Karween, who is changed into a crane. <a name="citation46b"></a><a href="#footnote46b">{46b}</a>&nbsp;
This is one of the many savage &aelig;tiological myths which account
for the peculiarities of animals as a result of metamorphosis, in the
manner of Ovid.&nbsp; It has been connected with the legend of Bunjil,
who is thus envisaged, not as &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo; beyond the vault
of heaven, who still inspires poets, <a name="citation46c"></a><a href="#footnote46c">{46c}</a>
but as a wandering, shape-shifting medicine-man.&nbsp; Zeus, the Heavenly
Father, of course appears times without number in the same contradictory
aspect.</p>
<p>But such anecdotes are either not common, or are not frequently reported,
in the faiths of the most archaic of known races.&nbsp; Much more frequently
we find the totemistic conception.&nbsp; All the kindreds with animal
names <!-- page 47--><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>(why adopted
we do not know) are apt to explain these designations by descent from
the animals selected, or by metamorphosis of the primal beasts into
men.&nbsp; This collides with the other notions of descent from, or
creation or manufacture out of clay, by the primal Being, &ldquo;Father
Ours.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such contradictions are nothing to the savage theologian,
who is no reconciler or apologist.&nbsp; But when reconciliation and
apology are later found to be desirable, as in Greece, it is easy to
explain that we are descended <i>both</i> from Our Father, and from
a swan, cow, ant, serpent, dog, wolf, or what you will.&nbsp; That beast
was Our Father, say Father Zeus, in animal disguise.&nbsp; Thus Greek
legends of bestial amours of a God are probably, in origin, not primitive,
but scandals produced in the effort to reconcile contradictory myths.&nbsp;
The result is a worse scandal, an accretion of more low myths about
a conception of the primal Being which was, relatively, lofty and pure.</p>
<p>Again, as aristocracies arose, the chief families desired to be sons
of the Father in a <!-- page 48--><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>special
sense: not as common men are.&nbsp; Her Majesty&rsquo;s lineage may
thus be traced to Woden!&nbsp; Now each such descent required a separate
divine amour, and a new scandalous story of Zeus or Apollo, though Zeus
may originally have been as celibate as the Australian Baiame or Noorele
are, in some legends.&nbsp; Once more, syncretism came in as a mythop&oelig;ic
influence.&nbsp; Say that several Australian nations, becoming more
polite, amalgamated into a settled people.&nbsp; Then we should have
several Gods, the chief Beings of various tribes, say Noorele, Bunjil,
Mungan-ngaur, Baiame, Daramulun, Mangarrah, Mulkari, Pinmeheal.&nbsp;
The most imposing God of the dominant tribe might be elevated to the
sovereignty of Zeus.&nbsp; But, in the new administration, places must
be found for the other old tribal Gods.&nbsp; They are, therefore, set
over various departments: Love, War, Agriculture, Medicine, Poetry,
Commerce, while one or more of the sons take the places of Apollo and
Hermes.&nbsp; There appears to be a very early example of syncretism
in <!-- page 49--><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>Australia.&nbsp;
Daramulun (Papang, Our Father) is &ldquo;Master of All,&rdquo; on the
coast, near Shoalhaven River.&nbsp; Baiame is &ldquo;Master of All,&rdquo;
far north, on the Barwan.&nbsp; But the locally intermediate tribe of
the Wiraijuri, or Wiradthuri, have adopted Baiame, and reduced Daramulun
to an exploded bugbear, a merely nominal superintendent of the Mysteries;
and the southern Coast Murring have rejected Baiame altogether, or never
knew him, while making Daramulun supreme.</p>
<p>One obvious method of reconciling various tribal Gods in a syncretic
Olympus, is the genealogical.&nbsp; All are children of Zeus, for example,
or grandchildren, or brothers and sisters.&nbsp; Fancy then provides
an amour to account for each relationship.&nbsp; Zeus loved Leto, Leda,
Europa, and so forth.&nbsp; Thus a God, originally innocent and even
moral, becomes a perfect pattern of vice; and the eternal contradiction
vexes the souls of Xenophanes, Plato, and St. Augustine.&nbsp; Sacrifices,
even human sacrifices, wholly unknown to the most archaic faiths, were
made to ghosts of <!-- page 50--><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>men:
and especially of kings, in the case of human sacrifice.&nbsp; Thence
they were transferred to Gods, and behold a new scandal, when men began
to reflect under more civilised conditions.&nbsp; Thus all these legends
of divine amours and sins, or most of them, including the wanton legend
of Aphrodite, and all the human sacrifices which survived to the disgrace
of Greek religion, are really degrading accessories to the most archaic
beliefs.&nbsp; They are products, not of the most rudimentary savage
existence, but of the evolution through the lower and higher barbarism.&nbsp;
The worst features of savage ritual are different&mdash;taking the lines
of sorcery, of cruel initiations, and, perhaps, of revival of the licence
of promiscuity, or of Group Marriage.&nbsp; Of these things the traces
are not absent from Greek faith, but they are comparatively inconspicuous.</p>
<p>Buffoonery, as we have seen, exists in all grades of civilised or
savage rites, and was not absent from the popular festivals of the medi&aelig;val
Church: religion throwing her mantle <!-- page 51--><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>over
every human field of action, as over Folk Medicine.&nbsp; On these lines
I venture to explain what seem to me the strange and repugnant elements
of the religion of a people so refined, and so capable of high moral
ideas, as the Greeks.&nbsp; Aphrodite is personified desire, but religion
did not throw her mantle over desire alone; the cloistered life, the
frank charm of maidenhood, were as dear to the Greek genius, and were
consecrated by the examples of Athene, Artemis, and Hestia.&nbsp; She
presides over the pure element of the fire of the hearth, just as in
the household did the daughter of the king or chief.&nbsp; Hers are
the first libations at feasts (xxviii. 5), though in Homer they are
poured forth to Hermes.</p>
<p>We may explain the Gods of the minor hymns in the same way.&nbsp;
Pan, for instance, as the son of Hermes, inherits the wild, frolicsome,
rural aspect of his character.&nbsp; The Dioscuri answer to the Vedic
Asvins, twin rescuers of men in danger on land or sea: perhaps the Evening
and Morning Star. <!-- page 52--><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>
Dionysus is another aspect of the joy of life and of the world and the
vintaging.&nbsp; Moon and Sun, Selene and Helios, appear as quite distinct
from Artemis and Apollo; G&aelig;a, the Earth, is equally distinct from
Demeter.&nbsp; The Hymn to Ares is quite un-Homeric in character, and
is oddly conceived in the spirit of the Scottish poltroon, who cries
to his friend, &ldquo;Haud me, haud me, or I&rsquo;ll fecht!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The war-god is implored to moderate the martial eagerness of the poet.&nbsp;
The original collector here showed lack of discrimination.&nbsp; At
no time, however, was Ares a popular God in Greece; in Homer he is a
braggart and coward. <!-- page 53--><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span></p>
<h2>THE HYMN TO DEMETER</h2>
<p>The beautiful Hymn to Demeter, an example of Greek religious faith
in its most pensive and most romantic aspects, was found in the last
century (1780), in Moscow.&nbsp; <i>Inter pullos et porcos latitabat</i>:
the song of the rural deity had found its way into the haunts of the
humble creatures whom she protected.&nbsp; A discovery even more fortunate,
in 1857, led Sir Charles Newton to a little <i>sacellum</i>, or family
chapel, near Cnidos.&nbsp; On a platform of rock, beneath a cliff, and
looking to the Mediterranean, were the ruins of the ancient shrine:
the votive offerings; the lamps long without oil or flame; the Curses,
or Dir&aelig;, inscribed on thin sheets of lead, and directed against
thieves or rivals.&nbsp; The head of the statue, itself already known,
was also discovered.&nbsp; Votive offerings, cheap curses, <!-- page 54--><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>objects
of folk-lore rite and of sympathetic magic,&mdash;these are connected
with the popular, the peasant aspect of the religion of Demeter.&nbsp;
She it is to whom pigs are sacrificed: who makes the fields fertile
with scattered fragments of their flesh; and her rustic effigy, at Theocritus&rsquo;s
feast of the harvest home, stands smiling, with corn and poppies in
her hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="Mourning Demeter.  Marble statue from Knidos.  In the British Museum" src="images/lang54s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>But the Cnidian shrine had once another treasure, the beautiful melancholy
statue of the seated Demeter of the uplifted eyes; the mourning mother:
the weary seeker for the lost maiden: her child Persephone.&nbsp; Far
from the ruins above the sea, beneath the scorched seaward wall of rock:
far from the aromatic fragrance of the rock-nourished flowers, from
the bees, and the playful lizards, Demeter now occupies her place in
the great halls of the British Museum.&nbsp; Like the Hymn, this melancholy
and tender work of art is imperfect, but the sentiment is thereby rather
increased than impaired.&nbsp; The ancients buried things broken with
the dead, <!-- page 55--><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>that the
shadows of tool, or weapon, or vase might be set free, to serve the
shadows of their masters in the land of the souls.&nbsp; Broken as they,
too, are, the Hymn and the statue are &ldquo;free among the dead,&rdquo;
and eloquent of the higher religion that, in Greece, attached itself
to the lost Maiden and the sorrowing Mother.&nbsp; Demeter, in religion,
was more than a fertiliser of the fields: Kor&ecirc;, the Maiden, was
more than the buried pig, or the seed sown to await its resurrection;
or the harvest idol, fashioned of corn-stalks: more even than a symbol
of the winter sleep and vernal awakening of the year and the life of
nature.&nbsp; She became the &ldquo;dread Persephone&rdquo; of the Odyssey,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Queen over death and the dead.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In her winter retreat below the earth she was the bride of the Lord
of Many Guests, and the ruler &ldquo;of the souls of men outworn.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In this office Odysseus in Homer knows her, though neither Iliad nor
Odyssey recognises <i>Kor&ecirc;</i> as the maiden Spring, the daughter
and <!-- page 56--><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>companion of Demeter
as Goddess of Grain.&nbsp; Christianity, even, did not quite dethrone
Persephone.&nbsp; She lives in two forms: first, as the harvest effigy
made of corn-stalks bound together, the last gleanings; secondly, as
&ldquo;the Fairy Queen Proserpina,&rdquo; who carried Thomas the Rhymer
from beneath the Eildon Tree to that land which lies beyond the stream
of slain men&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For a&rsquo; the bluid that&rsquo;s shed on earth<br />
Flows through the streams of that countrie.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus tenacious of life has been the myth of <!-- page 57--><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Mother
and Maiden, a natural flower of the human heart, found, unborrowed,
by the Spaniards in the maize-fields of Peru.&nbsp; Clearly the myth
is a thing composed of many elements, glad and sad as the waving fields
of yellow grain, or as the Chthonian darkness under earth where the
seed awaits new life in the new year.&nbsp; The creed is practical as
the folk-lore of sympathetic magic, which half expects to bring good
harvest luck by various mummeries; and the creed is mystical as the
hidden things and words unknown which assured Pindar and Sophocles of
secure felicity in this and in the future life.</p>
<p>The creed is beautiful as the exquisite profile of the corn-tressed
head of Persephone on Syracusan coins: and it is grotesque as the custom
which bade the pilgrims to Eleusis bathe in the sea, each with the pig
which he was about to sacrifice.&nbsp; The highest religious hopes,
the meanest magical mummeries are blended in this religion.&nbsp; That
one element is earlier than the other we cannot say with much certainty.&nbsp;
The ritual <!-- page 58--><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>aspect,
as concerned with the happy future of the soul, does not appear in Iliad
or Odyssey, where the Mysteries are not named.&nbsp; But the silence
of Homer is never a safe argument in favour of his ignorance, any more
than the absence of allusion to tobacco in Shakspeare is a proof that
tobacco was, in his age, unknown.</p>
<p>We shall find that a barbaric people, the Pawnees, hold a mystery
precisely parallel to the Demeter legend: a Mystery necessarily unborrowed
from Greece.&nbsp; The Greeks, therefore, may have evolved the legend
long before Homer&rsquo;s day, and he may have known the story which
he does not find occasion to tell.&nbsp; As to what was said, shown,
and done in the Eleusinia, we only gather that there was a kind of Mystery
Play on the sacred legend; that there were fastings, vigils, sacrifices,
secret objects displayed, sacred words uttered; and that thence such
men as Pindar and Sophocles received the impression that for them, in
this and the future life, all was well, was well for those of pure hearts
and <!-- page 59--><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>hands.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;purity&rdquo; may partly have been ritual, but was certainly
understood, also, as relating to excellence of life.&nbsp; Than such
a faith (for faith it is) religion has nothing better to give.&nbsp;
But the extreme diligence of scholars and arch&aelig;ologists can tell
us nothing more definite.&nbsp; The impressions on the souls of the
initiated may have been caused merely by that dim or splendid religious
light of the vigils, and by association with sacred things usually kept
in solemn sanctuaries.&nbsp; Again, mere buffoonery (as is common in
savage Mysteries) brought the pilgrims back to common life when they
crossed the bridge on their return to Athens; just as the buffooneries
of Baubo brought a smile to the sad lips of Demeter.&nbsp; Beyond this
all is conjecture, and the secret may have been so well kept just because,
in fact, there was no secret to keep. <a name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59">{59}</a>
<!-- page 60--><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span></p>
<p>Till the end of the present century, mythologists did not usually
employ the method of comparing Greek rites and legends with, first,
the sympathetic magic and the fables of peasant folk-lore; second, with
the Mysteries and myths of contemporary savage races, of which European
folk-lore is mainly a survival.&nbsp; For a study of Demeter from these
sides (a study still too much neglected in Germany) readers may consult
Mannhardt&rsquo;s works, Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golden Bough,&rdquo;
and the present translator&rsquo;s &ldquo;Custom and Myth,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Myth, Ritual, and Religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Frazer, especially,
has enabled the English reader to understand the savage and rural element
of sympathetic magic as a factor in the Demeter myth.&nbsp; Meanwhile
Mr. Pater has dealt with the higher sentiment, the more religious aspect,
of the myth and the rites.&nbsp; I am not inclined to go all lengths
with Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s ingenious and learned system, as will be seen,
while regretting that the new edition of his &ldquo;Golden Bough&rdquo;
is not yet accessible. <!-- page 61--><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span></p>
<p>If we accept (which I do not entirely) Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s theory
of the origin of the Demeter myth, there is no finer example of the
Greek power of transforming into beauty the superstitions of Barbarism.&nbsp;
The explanation to which I refer is contained in Mr. J. G. Frazer&rsquo;s
learned and ingenious work, &ldquo;The Golden Bough.&rdquo;&nbsp; While
mythologists of the schools of Mr. Max M&uuml;ller and Kuhn have usually
resolved most Gods and heroes into Sun, Sky, Dawn, Twilight; or, again,
into elemental powers of Thunder, Tempest, Lightning, and Night, Mr.
Frazer is apt to see in them the Spirit of Vegetation.&nbsp; Osiris
is a Tree Spirit or a Corn Spirit (Mannhardt, the founder of the system,
however, took Osiris to be the Sun).&nbsp; Balder is the Spirit of the
Oak.&nbsp; The oak, &ldquo;we may certainly conclude, was one of the
chief, if not the very chief divinity of the Aryans before the dispersion.&rdquo;
<a name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61">{61}</a>&nbsp; If so,
the Aryans before the dispersion were on an infinitely lower religious
level than those Australian tribes, whose chief divinity <!-- page 62--><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>is
not a gum-tree, but a being named &ldquo;Our Father,&rdquo; dwelling
beyond the visible heavens.&nbsp; When we remember the vast numbers
of gods of sky or heaven among many scattered races, and the obvious
connection of Zeus with the sky (<i>sub Jove frigido</i>), and the usually
assigned sense of the name of Zeus, it is not easy to suppose that he
was originally an oak.&nbsp; But Mr. Frazer considers the etymological
connection of Zeus with the Sanscrit word for sky, an insufficient reason
for regarding Zeus as, in origin, a sky-god.&nbsp; He prefers, it seems,
to believe that, as being the wood out of which fire was kindled by
some Aryan-speaking peoples, the oak may have come to be called &ldquo;The
Bright or Shining One&rdquo; (Zeus, Jove), by the ancient Greeks and
Italians. <a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62">{62}</a>&nbsp;
The Greeks, in fact, used the laurel (<i>daphne</i>) for making fire,
not, as far as I am aware, the oak.&nbsp; Though the oak was the tree
of Zeus, the heavens were certainly his province, and, despite the oak
of Dodona, and the oak on the Capitol, he is much more generally <!-- page 63--><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>connected
with the sky than with the tree.&nbsp; In fact this reduction of Zeus,
in origin, to an oak, rather suggests that the spirit of system is too
powerful with Mr. Frazer.</p>
<p>He makes, perhaps, a more plausible case for his reduction of dread
Persephone to a Pig.&nbsp; The process is curious.&nbsp; Early agricultural
man believed in a Corn Spirit, a spiritual essence animating the grain
(in itself no very unworthy conception).&nbsp; But because, as the field
is mown, animals in the corn are driven into the last unshorn nook,
and then into the open, the beast which rushed out of the last patch
was identified with the Corn Spirit in some animal shape, perhaps that
of a pig; many other animals occur.&nbsp; The pig has a great part in
the ritual of Demeter.&nbsp; Pigs of pottery were found by Sir Charles
Newton on her sacred ground.&nbsp; The initiate in the Mysteries brought
pigs to Eleusis, and bathed with them in the sea.&nbsp; The pig was
sacrificed to her; in fact (though not in our Hymn) she was closely
associated with pigs.&nbsp; &ldquo;We may now ask . . . may not the
pig be nothing <!-- page 64--><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>but
the Goddess herself in animal form?&rdquo; <a name="citation64a"></a><a href="#footnote64a">{64a}</a>&nbsp;
She would later become anthropomorphic: a lovely Goddess, whose hair,
as in the Hymn, is &ldquo;yellow as ripe corn.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
prior pig could not be shaken off.&nbsp; At the Attic Thesmophoria the
women celebrated the Descent and Ascent of Persephone,&mdash;a &ldquo;double&rdquo;
of Demeter.&nbsp; In this rite pigs and other things were thrown into
certain caverns.&nbsp; Later, the cold remains of pig were recovered
and placed on the altar.&nbsp; Fragments were scattered for luck on
the fields with the seed-corn.&nbsp; A myth explained that a flock of
pigs were swallowed by Earth when Persephone was ravished by Hades to
the lower world, of which matter the Hymn says nothing.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
short, the pigs were Proserpine.&rdquo; <a name="citation64b"></a><a href="#footnote64b">{64b}</a>&nbsp;
The eating of pigs at the Thesmophoria was &ldquo;a partaking of the
body of the God,&rdquo; though the partakers, one thinks, must have
been totally unconscious of the circumstance.&nbsp; We must presume
that (if this theory be correct) a very considerable time was needed
for the <!-- page 65--><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>evolution of
a pig into the Demeter of the Hymn, and the change is quite successfully
complete; a testimony to the transfiguring power of the Greek genius.</p>
<p>We may be inclined to doubt, however, whether the task before the
genius of Greece, the task of making Proserpine out of a porker, was
really so colossal.&nbsp; The primitive mind is notoriously capable
of entertaining, simultaneously, the most contradictory notions.&nbsp;
Thus, in the Australian &ldquo;Legend of Eerin,&rdquo; the mourners
implore Byamee to accept the soul of the faithful Eerin into his Paradise,
Bullimah.&nbsp; No doubt Byamee heard, yet Eerin is now a little owl
of plaintive voice, which ratters warning cries in time of peril. <a name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65">{65}</a>&nbsp;
No incongruity of this kind is felt to be a difficulty by the childlike
narrators.&nbsp; Now I conceive that, starting with the relatively high
idea of a Spirit of the Grain, early man was quite capable of envisaging
it both spiritually and in zoomorphic form (accidentally <!-- page 66--><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>conditioned
here into horse, there into goat, pig, or what not).&nbsp; But these
views of his need not exclude his simultaneous belief in the Corn Spirit
as a being anthropomorphic, &ldquo;Mother Earth,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mother
Grain,&rdquo; as we follow the common etymology; or that of Mannhardt
(&zeta;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha; (<i>d&aelig;a</i>) &mu;&eta;&tau;&eta;&rho;=&ldquo;barley-mother&rdquo;).&nbsp;
If I am right, poetry and the higher religion moved from the first on
the line of the anthropomorphic Lady of the Harvest and the Corn, Mother
Barley: while the popular folk-lore of the Corn Spirit (which found
utterance in the mirth of harvesting, and in the magic ritual for ensuring
fertility), followed on the line of the pig.&nbsp; At some seasons,
and in some ceremonies, the pig represented the genius of the corn:
in general, the Lady of the Corn was&mdash;Demeter.&nbsp; We really
need not believe that the two forms of the genius of the corn were ever
<i>consciously</i> identified.&nbsp; Demeter never was a Pig! <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66">{66}</a>
<!-- page 67--><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Peruvians, we are told, believed all useful plants to
be animated by a divine being who causes their growth,&rdquo; says Mr.
Frazer. <a name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67">{67}</a>&nbsp;
The genealogical table, then, in my opinion, is:&mdash;</p>
<pre>Divine Being of the Grain.
            |
  +---------+--------------------------+
  |                                    |
(<i>Anthropomorphized</i>).             (<i>Zoomorphised</i>).
Mother of Corn.                    Pig, Horse,
    Demeter.                         and so on.</pre>
<p>Thus the Greek genius had other and better materials to work on,
in evolving Demeter, than the rather lowly animal which is associated
with her rites.&nbsp; If any one objects that animal gods always precede
anthropomorphic gods in evolution, we reply that, in the most archaic
of known races, the deities are represented in human guise at the Mysteries,
though there are animal Totems, and though, in myth, the deity <!-- page 68--><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>may,
and often does, assume shapes of bird or beast. <a name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68">{68}</a></p>
<p>Among rites of the backward races, none, perhaps, so closely resembles
the Eleusinian Mysteries as the tradition of the Pawnees.&nbsp; In Attica,
Hades, Lord of the Dead, ravishes away Persephone, the vernal daughter
of Demeter.&nbsp; Demeter then wanders among men, and is hospitably
received by Celeus, King of Eleusis.&nbsp; Baffled in her endeavour
to make his son immortal, she demands a temple, where she sits in wrath,
blighting the grain.&nbsp; She is reconciled by the restoration of her
daughter, at the command of Zeus.&nbsp; But for a third of the year
Persephone, having tasted a pomegranate seed in Hades, has to reign
as Queen of the Dead, beneath the earth.&nbsp; Scenes from this tale
were, no doubt, enacted at the Mysteries, with interludes of buffoonery,
such as relieved most ancient and all savage Mysteries.&nbsp; The allegory
of the year&rsquo;s death and renewal probably afforded a text for some
<!-- page 69--><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>discourse, or spectacle,
concerned with the future life.</p>
<p>Among the Pawnees, not a mother and daughter, but two primal beings,
brothers, named Manabozho and Chibiabos, are the chief characters.&nbsp;
The Manitos (spirits or gods) drown Chibiabos.&nbsp; Manabozho mourns
and smears his face with black, as Demeter wears black raiment.&nbsp;
He laments Chibiabos ceaselessly till the Manitos propitiate him with
gifts and ceremonies.&nbsp; They offer to him a cup, like the beverage
prepared for Demeter, in the Hymn, by Iamb&ecirc;.&nbsp; He drinks it,
is glad, washes off the black stain of mourning, and is himself again,
while Earth again is joyous.&nbsp; The Manitos restore Chibiabos to
life; but, having once died, he may not enter the temple, or &ldquo;Medicine
Lodge.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is sent to reign over the souls of the departed
as does Persephone.&nbsp; Manabozho makes offerings to Mesukkumikokwi,
the &ldquo;Earth Mother&rdquo; of the Pawnees.&nbsp; The story is enacted
in the sacred dances of the Pawnees. <a name="citation69"></a><a href="#footnote69">{69}</a>
<!-- page 70--><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span></p>
<p>The Pawnee ideas have fallen, with singularly accurate coincidence,
into the same lines as those of early Greece.&nbsp; Some moderns, such
as M. Foucart, have revived the opinion of Herodotus, that the Mysteries
were brought from Greece to Egypt.&nbsp; But, as the Pawnee example
shows, similar natural phenomena may anywhere beget similar myths and
rites.&nbsp; In Greece the <i>donn&eacute;e</i> was a nature myth, and
a ritual in which it was enacted.&nbsp; That ritual was a form of sympathetic
magic, and the myth explained the performances.&nbsp; The refinement
and charm of the legend (on which Homer, as we saw, does not touch)
is due to the unique genius of Greece.&nbsp; Demeter became the deity
most familiar to the people, nearest to their hearts and endowed with
most temples; every farm possessing her rural shrine.&nbsp; But the
Chthonian, or funereal, aspect of Chibiabos, or of Persephone, is due
to a mood very distinct from that which sacrifices pigs as embodiments
of the Corn Spirit, if that be the real origin of the practice. <!-- page 71--><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span></p>
<p>We should much misconceive the religious spirit of the Greek rite
if we undertook to develop it all out an origin in sympathetic magic:
which, of course, I do not understand Mr. Frazer to do.&nbsp; Greek
scholars, again, are apt to view these researches into savage or barbaric
origins with great distaste and disfavour.&nbsp; This is not a scientific
frame of mind.&nbsp; In the absence of such researches other purely
fanciful origins have been invented by scholars, ancient or modern.&nbsp;
It is necessary to return to the pedestrian facts, if merely in order
to demonstrate the futility of the fancies.&nbsp; The result is in no
way discreditable to Greece.&nbsp; Beginning, like other peoples, with
the vague unrealised conception of the Corn Mother (an idea which could
not occur before the agricultural stage of civilisation), the Greeks
refined and elevated the idea into the Demeter of the Hymn, and of the
Cnidian statue.&nbsp; To do this was the result of their unique gifts
as a race.&nbsp; Meanwhile the other notion of a Ruler of Souls, in
Greece attached to Persephone, is found <!-- page 72--><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>among
peoples not yet agricultural: nomads living on grubs, roots, seeds of
wild grasses, and the products of the chase.&nbsp; Almost all men&rsquo;s
ideas are as old as mankind, so far as we know mankind.</p>
<p>Conceptions originally &ldquo;half-conscious,&rdquo; and purely popular,
as of a Spirit of Vegetation, incarnate, as it were, in each year&rsquo;s
growth, were next handled by conscious poets, like the author of our
Hymn, and then are &ldquo;realised as abstract symbols, because intensely
characteristic examples of moral, or spiritual conditions.&rdquo; <a name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72">{72}</a>&nbsp;
Thus Demeter and Persephone, no longer pigs or Grain-Mothers, &ldquo;lend
themselves to the elevation and the correction of the sentiments of
sorrow and awe, by the presentment to the senses and imagination of
an ideal expression of them.&nbsp; Demeter cannot but seem the type
of divine grief.&nbsp; Persephone is the Goddess of Death, yet with
a promise of life to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the Eleusinia included an ethical <!-- page 73--><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>element
seems undeniable.&nbsp; This one would think probable, <i>a priori</i>,
on the ground that Greek Mysteries are an embellished survival of the
initiatory rites of savages, which do contain elements of morality.&nbsp;
This I have argued at some length in &ldquo;Myth, Ritual, and Religion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Many strange customs in some Greek Mysteries, such as the daubing of
the initiate with clay, the use of the &rho;&omicron;&mu;&beta;&omicron;&sigmaf;
(the Australian <i>Tundun</i>, a small piece of wood whirled noisily
by a string), the general suggestion of <i>a new life</i>, the flogging
of boys at Sparta, their retreat, each with his instructor (Australian
<i>kabbo</i>, Greek &epsilon;&iota;&sigma;&pi;&nu;&eta;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;)
to the forests, are precisely analogous to things found in Australia,
America, and Africa.&nbsp; Now savage rites are often associated with
what we think gross cruelty, and, as in Fiji, with abandoned license,
of which the Fathers also accuse the Greeks.&nbsp; But, among the Yao
of Central Africa, the initiator, observes Mr. Macdonald, &ldquo;is
said to give much good advice.&nbsp; His lectures condemn selfishness,
and a selfish <!-- page 74--><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>person
is called <i>mwisichana</i>, that is, &lsquo;uninitiated.&rsquo;&rdquo;
<a name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a">{74a}</a></p>
<p>Among the Australians, Dampier, in 1688, observed the singular unselfish
generosity of distribution of food to the old, the weak, and the sick.&nbsp;
According to Mr. Howitt, the boys of the Coast Murring tribe are taught
in the Mysteries &ldquo;to speak the straightforward truth while being
initiated, and are warned to avoid various offences against propriety
and morality.&rdquo;&nbsp; The method of instruction is bad, a pantomimic
representation of the sin to be avoided, but the intention is excellent.
<a name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b">{74b}</a>&nbsp; Among
the Kurnai respect for the old, for unprotected women, the duty of unselfishness,
and other ethical ideas are inculcated, <a name="citation74c"></a><a href="#footnote74c">{74c}</a>
while certain food taboos prevail during the rite, as was also the case
in the Eleusinia.&nbsp; That this moral idea of &ldquo;sharing what
they have with their friends&rdquo; is not confined merely to the tribe,
is proved by the experience of John Finnegan, a white <!-- page 75--><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>man
lost near Moreton Bay early in this century.&nbsp; &ldquo;At all times,
whether they had much or little, fish or kangaroo, they always gave
me as much as I could eat.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even when the whites stole the
fish of the natives, and were detected, &ldquo;instead of attempting
to repossess themselves of the fish, they instantly set at work to procure
more for us, and one or two fetched us as much <i>dingowa</i> as they
could carry.&rdquo; <a name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75">{75}</a>&nbsp;
The first English settlers in Virginia, on the other hand, when some
native stole a cup, burned down the whole town.</p>
<p>Thus the morality of the savage is not merely tribal (as is often
alleged), and is carried into practice, as well as inculcated, in some
regions, not in all, during the Mysteries.</p>
<p>For these reasons, if the Greek Mysteries be survivals of savage
ceremonies (as there is no reason to doubt that they are), the savage
association of moral instruction with mummeries might survive as easily
as <!-- page 76--><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>anything else.&nbsp;
That it did survive is plain from numerous passages in classical authors.
<a name="citation76a"></a><a href="#footnote76a">{76a}</a>&nbsp; The
initiate &ldquo;live a pious life in regard to strangers and citizens.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They are to be &ldquo;conscious of no evil&rdquo;: they are to &ldquo;protect
such as have wrought no unrighteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such precepts
&ldquo;have their root in the ethico-religious consciousness.&rdquo;
<a name="citation76b"></a><a href="#footnote76b">{76b}</a>&nbsp; It
is not mere ritual purity that the Mysteries demand, either among naked
Australians, or Yao, or in Greece.&nbsp; Lobeck did his best to minimise
the testimony to the higher element in the Eleusinia, but without avail.&nbsp;
The study of early, barbaric, savage, classical, Egyptian, or Indian
religions should not be one-sided.&nbsp; Men have always been men, for
good as well as for evil; and religion, almost everywhere, is allied
with ethics no less than it is overrun by the parasite of myth, and
the survival of magic in ritual.&nbsp; The Mother and the Maid were
&ldquo;Saviours&rdquo; (&Kappa;&omicron;&rho;&eta; &Sigma;&omega;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&alpha;),
<!-- page 77--><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>&ldquo;holy&rdquo;
and &ldquo;pure,&rdquo; despite contradictory legends. <a name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77">{77}</a>&nbsp;
The tales of incest, as between Zeus and Persephone, are the result
of the genealogical mania.&nbsp; The Gods were grouped in family-relationships,
to account for their companionship in ritual, and each birth postulated
an amour.&nbsp; None the less the same deities offered &ldquo;salvation,&rdquo;
of a sort, and were patrons of conduct.</p>
<p>Greek religion was thus not destitute of certain chief elements in
our own.&nbsp; But these were held in solution, with a host of other
warring elements, lustful, cruel, or buffooning.&nbsp; These elements
Greece was powerless to shake off; philosophers, by various expedients,
might explain away the contradictory myths which overgrew the religion,
but ritual, the luck of the State, and popular credulity, were tenacious
of the whole strange mingling of beliefs and practices.</p>

<p>The view taken of the Eleusinia in this <!-- page 78--><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>note
is hardly so exalted as that of Dr. Hatch.&nbsp; &ldquo;The main underlying
conception of initiation was that there were elements in human life
from which the candidate must purify himself before he could be fit
to approach God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The need of purification, ritual and moral,
is certain, but one is not aware of anything in the purely popular or
priestly religion of Greece which exactly answers to our word &ldquo;God&rdquo;
as used in the passage cited.&nbsp; Individuals, by dint of piety or
of speculation, might approach the conception, and probably many did,
both in and out of the philosophic schools.&nbsp; But traditional ritual
and myth could scarcely rise to this ideal; and it seems exaggerated
to say of the crowded Eleusinian throng of pilgrims that &ldquo;the
race of mankind was lifted on to a higher plane when it came to be taught
that only the pure in heart can see God.&rdquo; <a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78">{78}</a>
The black native boys in Australia pass through a <!-- page 79--><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>purgative
ceremony to cure them of selfishness, and afterwards the initiator points
to the blue vault of sky, bidding them behold &ldquo;Our Father, Mungan-ngaur.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is very well meant, and very creditable to untutored savages: and
creditable ideas were not absent from the Eleusinia.&nbsp; But when
we use the quotation, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
shall see God,&rdquo; our meaning, though not very definite, is a meaning
which it would be hazardous to attribute to a black boy,&mdash;or to
Sophocles.&nbsp; The idea of the New Life appears to occur in Australian
Mysteries: a tribesman is buried, and rises at a given signal.&nbsp;
But here the New Life is rather that of the lad admitted to full tribal
privileges (including moral precepts) than that of a converted character.&nbsp;
Confirmation, rather than conversion, is the analogy.&nbsp; The number
of those analogies of ancient and savage with Christian religion is
remarkable.&nbsp; But even in Greek Mysteries the conceptions are necessarily
not so <!-- page 80--><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>purely spiritual
as in the Christian creed, of which they seem half-conscious and fragmentary
anticipations.&nbsp; Or we may regard them as suggestions, which Christianity
selected, accepted, and purified. <!-- page 81--><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span></p>
<h2>HYMN TO DEMETER</h2>
<h3>THE ALLEGED EGYPTIAN ORIGINS</h3>
<p>In what has been said as to the Greek Mysteries, I have regarded
them as of native origin.&nbsp; I have exhibited rites of analogous
kinds in the germ, as it were, among savage and barbaric communities.&nbsp;
In Peru, under the Incas, we actually find Mama and Cora (Demeter and
Kor&ecirc;) as Goddesses of the maize (Acosta), and for rites of sympathetic
magic connected with the production of fertile harvests (as in the Thesmophoria
at Athens) it is enough to refer to the vast collection in Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Golden Bough.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have also indicated the closest
of all known parallels to the Eleusinian in a medicine-dance and legend
of the Pawnees.&nbsp; For other savage Mysteries in which a moral <!-- page 82--><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>element
occurs, I have quoted Australian and African examples.&nbsp; Thence
I have inferred that the early Greeks might, and probably did, evolve
their multiform mystic rites out of germs of such things inherited from
their own prehistoric ancestors.&nbsp; No process, on the other hand,
of borrowing from Greece can conceivably account for the Pawnee and
Peruvian rites, so closely analogous to those of Hellas.&nbsp; Therefore
I see no reason why, if Egypt, for instance, presents parallels to the
Eleusinia, we should suppose that the prehistoric Greeks borrowed the
Eleusinia from Egypt.&nbsp; These things can grow up, autochthonous
and underived, out of the soil of human nature anywhere, granting certain
social conditions.&nbsp; Monsieur Foucart, however, has lately argued
in favour of an Egyptian origin of the Eleusinia. <a name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82">{82}</a></p>
<p>The Greeks naturally identified Demeter and Dionysus with Isis and
Osiris.&nbsp; There were analogies in the figures and the legends, <!-- page 83--><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>and
that was enough.&nbsp; So, had the Greeks visited America, they would
have recognised Demeter in the Pawnee Earth Mother, and Persephone or
Eubouleus in Chibiabos.&nbsp; To account for the similarities they would
probably have invented a fable of Pawnee visitors to Greece, or of Greek
missionaries among the Pawnees.&nbsp; So they were apt to form a theory
of an Egyptian origin of Dionysus and Demeter.</p>
<p>M. Foucart, however, argues that agriculture, corn-growing at least,
came into Greece at one stride, barley and wheat not being indigenous
in a wild state.&nbsp; The Greeks, however, may have brought grain in
their original national migration (the Greek words for grain and ploughing
are common to other families of Aryan speech) or obtained it from Ph&oelig;nician
settlements.&nbsp; Demeter, however, in M. Foucart&rsquo;s theory, would
be the Goddess of the foreigners who carried the grain first to Hellas.&nbsp;
Now both the Homeric epics and the Egyptian monuments show us Egypt
and Greece in contact in the <!-- page 84--><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Greek
prehistoric period.&nbsp; But it does not exactly follow that the prehistoric
Greeks would adopt Egyptian gods; or that the Thesmophoria, an Athenian
harvest-rite of Demeter, was founded by colonists from Egypt, answering
to the daughters of Danaus. <a name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84">{84}</a>&nbsp;
Egyptians certainly did not introduce the similar rite among the Khonds,
or the Incas.&nbsp; The rites <i>could</i> grow up without importation,
as the result of the similarities of primitive fancy everywhere.&nbsp;
If Isis is Lady of the Grain in Egypt, so is Mama in Peru, and Demeter
need no more have been imported from Egypt than Mama.&nbsp; If Osiris
taught the arts of life and the laws of society in Egypt, so did Daramulun
in Australia, and Yehl in British Columbia.&nbsp; All the gods and culture
heroes everywhere play this <i>r&ocirc;le</i>&mdash;in regions where
importation of the idea from Egypt is utterly out of the question.&nbsp;
Even in minute details, legends recur everywhere; the <i>phallus</i>
of a mutilated Australian being of the fabulous &ldquo;Alcheringa time,&rdquo;
is hunted for <!-- page 85--><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>by his
wives; exactly as Isis wanders in search of the <i>phallus</i> of the
mutilated Osiris. <a name="citation85a"></a><a href="#footnote85a">{85a}</a>&nbsp;
Is anything in the Demeter legend so like the Isis legend as this Australian
coincidence?&nbsp; Yet the Arunta did not borrow it from Egypt. <a name="citation85b"></a><a href="#footnote85b">{85b}</a>&nbsp;
The mere fact, again, that there were Mysteries both in Egypt and Greece
proves nothing.&nbsp; There is a river in Monmouth, and a river in Macedon;
there are Mysteries in almost all religions.</p>
<p>Again, it is argued, the Gods of the Mysteries in Egypt and Greece
had secret names, only revealed to the initiated.&nbsp; So, too, in
Australia, women (never initiated) and boys before initiation, know
Daramulun only as Papang (Father). <a name="citation85c"></a><a href="#footnote85c">{85c}</a>&nbsp;
The uninitiated among the Kurnai do not know the sacred name, Mungan-ngaur.
<a name="citation85d"></a><a href="#footnote85d">{85d}</a>&nbsp; The
Australian did not borrow this secrecy from Egypt.&nbsp; Everywhere
a <!-- page 86--><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>mystery is kept up
about proper names.&nbsp; M. Foucart seems to think that what is practically
universal, a taboo on names, can only have reached Greece by transplantation
from Egypt. <a name="citation86a"></a><a href="#footnote86a">{86a}</a>&nbsp;
To the anthropologist it seems that scholars, in ignoring the universal
ideas of the lower races, run the risk of venturing on theories at once
superficial and untenable.</p>
<p>M. Foucart has another argument, which does not seem more convincing,
though it probably lights up the humorous or indecent side of the Eleusinia.&nbsp;
Isocrates speaks of &ldquo;good offices&rdquo; rendered to Demeter by
&ldquo;our ancestors,&rdquo; which &ldquo;can only be told to the initiate.&rdquo;
<a name="citation86b"></a><a href="#footnote86b">{86b}</a>&nbsp; Now
these cannot be the kindly deeds reported in the Hymn, for these were
publicly proclaimed.&nbsp; What, then, were the <i>secret</i> good offices?&nbsp;
In one version of the legend the hosts of Demeter were not Celeus and
Metaneira, but Dusaules and Baubo.&nbsp; The part of Baubo was to relieve
the gloom of <!-- page 87--><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>the Goddess,
not by the harmless pleasantries of Iamb&ecirc;, in the Hymn, but by
obscene gestures.&nbsp; The Christian Fathers, Clemens of Alexandria
at least, make this a part of their attack on the Mysteries; but it
may be said that they were prejudiced or misinformed. <a name="citation87a"></a><a href="#footnote87a">{87a}</a>&nbsp;
But, says M. Foucart, an inscription has been found in Paros, wherein
there is a dedication to Hera, Demeter Thesmophoros, Kor&ecirc;, and
<i>Babo</i>, or Baubo.&nbsp; Again, two authors of the fourth century,
Pal&aelig;phatus and Asclepiades, cite the Dusaules and Baubo legend.
<a name="citation87b"></a><a href="#footnote87b">{87b}</a></p>
<p>Now the indecent gesture of Baubo was part of the comic or obscene
folk-lore of contempt in Egypt, and so M. Foucart thinks that it was
borrowed from Egypt with the Demeter legend. <a name="citation87c"></a><a href="#footnote87c">{87c}</a>&nbsp;
Can Isocrates have referred to <i>this</i> good office?&mdash;the amusing
of Demeter by an obscene gesture?&nbsp; If he did, such gestures as
Baubo&rsquo;s are as widely diffused as any other piece of folk-lore.&nbsp;
In the centre of <!-- page 88--><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>the
Australian desert Mr. Carnegie saw a native make a derisive gesture
which he thought had only been known to English schoolboys. <a name="citation88a"></a><a href="#footnote88a">{88a}</a>&nbsp;
Again, indecent pantomimic dances, said to be intended to act as &ldquo;object
lessons&rdquo; in things <i>not</i> to be done, are common in Australian
Mysteries.&nbsp; Further, we do not know Baubo, or a counterpart of
her, in the ritual of Isis, and the clay figurines of such a figure,
in Egypt, are of the Greek, the Ptolemaic period.&nbsp; Thus the evidence
comes to this: an indecent gesture of contempt, known in Egypt, is,
at Eleusis, attributed to Baubo.&nbsp; This does not prove that Baubo
was originally Egyptian. <a name="citation88b"></a><a href="#footnote88b">{88b}</a>&nbsp;
Certain traditions make Demeter the mistress of Celeus. <a name="citation88c"></a><a href="#footnote88c">{88c}</a>&nbsp;
Traces of a &ldquo;mystic marriage,&rdquo; which also occur, are not
necessarily Egyptian: the idea and rite are common.</p>
<p>There remains the question of the sacred objects displayed (possibly
statues, probably very ancient &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; things, as among
the Pawnees) and sacred words spoken. <!-- page 89--><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>
These are said by many authors to confirm the initiate in their security
of hope as to a future life.&nbsp; Now similar instruction, as to the
details of the soul&rsquo;s voyage, the dangers to avoid, the precautions
to be taken, notoriously occur in the Egyptian &ldquo;Book of the Dead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But very similar fancies are reported from the Ojibbeways (Kohl), the
Polynesians and Maoris (Taylor, Turner, Gill, Thomson), the early peoples
of Virginia, <a name="citation89a"></a><a href="#footnote89a">{89a}</a>
the modern Arapaho and Sioux of the Ghost Dance rite, the Aztecs, and
so forth.&nbsp; In all countries these details are said to have been
revealed by men or women who died, but did not (like Persephone) taste
the food of the dead; and so were enabled to return to earth.&nbsp;
The initiate, at Eleusis, were guided along a theatrically arranged
pathway of the dead, into a theatrical Elysium. <a name="citation89b"></a><a href="#footnote89b">{89b}</a>&nbsp;
Now as such ideas as these occur among races utterly removed from contact
with Egypt, as they are part of the European folk-lore of the visits
of mortals to fairyland (in which it is <!-- page 90--><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>fatal
to taste fairy food), I do not see that Eleusis need have borrowed such
common elements of early belief from the Egyptians in the seventh century
B.C. <a name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90">{90}</a>&nbsp; One
might as well attribute to Egypt the Finnish legend of the descent of
Wainamoinen into Tuonela; or the experience of the aunt of Montezuma
just before the arrival of Cort&egrave;s; or the expedition to fairyland
of Thomas the Rhymer.&nbsp; It is not pretended by M. Foucart that the
<i>details</i> of the &ldquo;Book of the Dead&rdquo; were copied in
Greek ritual; and the general idea of a river to cross, of dangerous
monsters to avoid, of perils to encounter, of precautions to be taken
by the wandering soul, is nearly universal, where it must be unborrowed
from Egypt, in Polynesian and Red Indian belief.&nbsp; As at Eleusis,
in these remote tribes formulas of a preservative character are inculcated.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Book of the Dead&rdquo; was a guidebook of the itinerary
of Egyptian souls.&nbsp; Very probably similar instruction was given
to the initiate at Eleusis.&nbsp; But the Fijians also have <!-- page 91--><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>a
regular theory of what is to be done and avoided on &ldquo;The Path
of the Shades.&rdquo;&nbsp; The shade is ferried by Ceba (Charon) over
Wainiyalo (Lethe); he reaches the mystic pandanus tree (here occurs
a rite); he meets, and dodges, Drodroyalo and the two devouring Goddesses;
he comes to a spring, and drinks, and forgets sorrow at Wai-na-dula,
the &ldquo;Water of Solace.&rdquo;&nbsp; After half-a-dozen other probations
and terrors, he reaches the Gods, &ldquo;the dancing-ground and the
white quicksand; and then the young Gods dance before them and sing.
. . . &rdquo; <a name="citation91a"></a><a href="#footnote91a">{91a}</a></p>
<p>Now turn to Plutarch. <a name="citation91b"></a><a href="#footnote91b">{91b}</a>&nbsp;
Plutarch compares the soul&rsquo;s mortal experience with that of the
initiate in the Mysteries.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are wanderings, darkness,
fear, trembling, shuddering, horror, then a marvellous light: pure places
and meadows, dances, songs, and holy apparitions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Plutarch
might be summarising <!-- page 92--><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>the
Fijian belief.&nbsp; Again, take the mystic golden scroll, found in
a Greek grave at Petilia.&nbsp; It describes in hexameters the Path
of the Shade: the spring and the white cypress on the left: &ldquo;Do
not approach it.&nbsp; Go to the other stream from the Lake of Memory;
tell the Guardians that you are the child of Earth and of the starry
sky, but that yours is a heavenly lineage; and they will give you to
drink of that water, and you shall reign with the other heroes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tree, and spring, and peaceful place with dance, song, and divine
apparitions, all are Fijian, all are Greek, yet nothing is borrowed
by Fiji from Greece.&nbsp; Many other Greek inscriptions cited by M.
Foucart attest similar beliefs.&nbsp; Very probably such precepts as
those of the Petilia scroll were among the secret instructions of Eleusis.&nbsp;
But they are not so much Egyptian as human.&nbsp; Chibiabos is assuredly
not borrowed from Osiris, nor the Fijian faith from the &ldquo;Book
of the Dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sacred things,&rdquo; not to be shown
to man, still less to woman, date from the &ldquo;medicine <!-- page 93--><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>bag&rdquo;
of the Red Indian, the mystic tribal bundles of the Pawnees, and the
<i>churinga</i>, and bark &ldquo;native portmanteaux,&rdquo; of which
Mr. Carnegie brought several from the Australian desert.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>For all Greek Mysteries a satisfactory savage analogy can be found.&nbsp;
These spring straight from human nature: from the desire to place customs,
and duties, and taboos under divine protection; from the need of strengthening
them, and the influence of the elders, by mystic sanctions; from the
need of fortifying and trying the young by probations of strength, secrecy,
and fortitude; from the magical expulsion of hostile influences; from
the sympathetic magic of early agriculture; from study of the processes
of nature regarded as personal; and from guesses, surmises, visions,
and dreams as to the fortunes of the wandering soul on its way to its
final home.&nbsp; I have shown all these things to be human, universal,
not sprung from one race in one region.&nbsp; Greek Mysteries are based
on all these natural early <!-- page 94--><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>conceptions
of life and death.&nbsp; The early Greeks, like other races, entertained
these primitive, or very archaic ideas.&nbsp; Greece had no need to
borrow from Egypt; and, though Egypt was within reach, Greece probably
developed freely her original stock of ideas in her own fashion, just
as did the Incas, Aztecs, Australians, Ojibbeways, and the other remote
peoples whom I have selected.&nbsp; The argument of M. Foucart, I think,
is only good as long as we are ignorant of the universally diffused
forms of religious belief which correspond to the creeds of Eleusis
or of Egypt.&nbsp; In the Greek Mysteries we have the Greek guise,&mdash;solemn,
wistful, hopeful, holy, and pure, yet not uncontaminated with archaic
buffoonery,&mdash;of notions and rites, hopes and fears, common to all
mankind.&nbsp; There is no other secret.</p>
<p>The same arguments as I have advanced against Greek borrowing from
Egypt, apply to Greek borrowing from Asia.&nbsp; Mr. Ramsay, following
Mr. Robertson Smith, suggests that Leto, the mother of Apollo and Artemis,
<!-- page 95--><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>may be &ldquo;the old
Semitic Al-lat.&rdquo; <a name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a">{95a}</a>&nbsp;
Then we have Leto and Artemis, as the Mother and the Maid (Kor&ecirc;)
with their mystery play.&nbsp; &ldquo;Clement describes them&rdquo;
(the details) as &ldquo;Eleusinian, for they had spread to Eleusis as
the rites of Demeter and Kor&ecirc; <i>crossing from Asia to Crete,
and from Crete to the European</i> peninsula.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ritual
&ldquo;remained everywhere fundamentally the same.&rdquo;&nbsp; Obviously
if the Eleusinian Mysteries are of Phrygian origin (Ramsay), they cannot
also be of Egyptian origin (Foucart).&nbsp; In truth they are no more
specially of Phrygian or Egyptian than of Pawnee or Peruvian origin.&nbsp;
Mankind can and does evolve such ideas and rites in any region of the
world. <a name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b">{95b}</a> <!-- page 96--><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span></p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What has all this farrago about savages to do with Dionysus?&rdquo;
I conceive some scholar, or literary critic asking, if such an one looks
into this book.&nbsp; Certainly it would have been easier for me to
abound in &aelig;sthetic criticism of the Hymns, and on the aspect of
Greek literary art which they illustrate.&nbsp; But the Hymns, if read
even through the pale medium of a translation, speak for themselves.&nbsp;
Their beauties and defects as poetry are patent: patent, too, are the
charm and geniality of the national character which they express.&nbsp;
The glad Ionian gatherings; the archaic humour; the delight in life,
and love, and nature; the pious domesticities of the sacred Hearth;
the peopling of woods, hills, and streams with exquisite fairy forms;
all these make the poetic delight of the Hymns.&nbsp; But all these
need no <!-- page 97--><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>pointing out
to any reader.&nbsp; The poets can speak for themselves.</p>
<p>On the other hand the confusions of sacred and profane; the origins
of the Mysteries; the beginnings of the Gods in a mental condition long
left behind by Greece when the Hymns were composed; all these matters
need elucidation.&nbsp; I have tried to elucidate them as results of
evolution from the remote prehistoric past of Greece, which, as it seems,
must in many points have been identical with the historic present of
the lowest contemporary races.&nbsp; In the same way, if dealing with
ornament, I would derive the spirals, volutes, and concentric circles
of Mycen&aelig;an gold work, from the identical motives, on the oldest
incised rocks and kists of our Islands, of North and South America,
and of the tribes of Central Australia, recently described by Messrs.
Spencer and Gillen, and Mr. Carnegie.&nbsp; The material of the Mycen&aelig;an
artist may be gold, his work may be elegant and firm, but he traces
the selfsame ornament as the naked Arunta, with feebler hand, paints
on sacred rocks or on the bodies <!-- page 98--><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>of
his tribesmen.&nbsp; What is true of ornament is true of myth, rite,
and belief.&nbsp; Greece only offers a gracious modification of the
beliefs, rites, and myths of the races who now are &ldquo;nearest the
beginning,&rdquo; however remote from that unknown beginning they may
be.&nbsp; To understand this is to come closer to a true conception
of the evolution of Greek faith and art than we can reach by any other
path.&nbsp; Yet to insist on this is not to ignore the unmeasured advance
of the Greeks in development of society and art.&nbsp; On that head
the Hymns, like all Greek poetry, bear their own free testimony.&nbsp;
But, none the less, Greek religion and myth present features repellent
to us, which derive their origin, not from savagery, but from the more
crude horrors of the lower and higher barbarisms.</p>
<p>Greek religion, Greek myth, are vast conglomerates.&nbsp; We find
a savage origin for Apollo, and savage origins for many of the Mysteries.&nbsp;
But the cruelty of savage initiations has been purified away.&nbsp;
On the <!-- page 99--><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>other hand,
we find a barbaric origin for departmental gods, such as Aphrodite,
and for Greek human sacrifices, unknown to the lowest savagery.&nbsp;
From savagery Zeus is probably derived; from savagery come the germs
of the legends of divine amours in animal forms.&nbsp; But from barbarism
arises the sympathetic magic of agriculture, which the lowest races
do not practise.&nbsp; From the barbaric condition, not from savagery,
comes Greek hero-worship, for the lowest races do not worship ancestral
spirits.&nbsp; Such is the medley of prehistoric ideas in Greece, while
the charm and poetry of the Hymns are due mainly to the unique genius
of the fully developed Hellenic race.&nbsp; The combination of good
and bad, of ancestral rites and ideas, of native taste, of philosophical
refinement on inherited theology, could not last; the elements were
too discordant.&nbsp; And yet it could not pass naturally away.&nbsp;

<p>without external assistance.&nbsp; That help was brought by the Christian
creed, and, officially, Gods, rites, and myths vanished, while, unofficially,
they partially endure, even to this day, in Romaic folk-lore. <!-- page 103--><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span></p>

<p>Mindful, ever mindful, will I be of Apollo the Far-darter.&nbsp;
Before him, as he fares through the hall of Zeus, the Gods tremble,
yea, rise up all from their thrones as he draws near with his shining
bended bow.&nbsp; But Leto alone abides by Zeus, the Lord of Lightning,
till Apollo hath slackened his bow and closed his quiver.&nbsp; Then,
taking with her hands from his mighty shoulders <!-- page 104--><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>the
bow and quiver, she hangs them against the pillar beside his father&rsquo;s
seat from a pin of gold, and leads him to his place and seats him there,
while the father welcomes his dear son, giving him nectar in a golden
cup; then do the other Gods welcome him; then they make him sit, and
Lady Leto rejoices, in that she bore the Lord of the Bow, her mighty
son.</p>
<p>[Hail!&nbsp; O blessed Leto; mother of glorious children, Prince
Apollo and Artemis the Archer; her in Ortygia, him in rocky Delos didst
thou bear, couching against the long sweep of the Cynthian Hill, beside

<p>How shall I hymn thee aright, howbeit thou art, in sooth, not hard
to hymn? <a name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104">{104}</a>
for to thee, Ph&oelig;bus, everywhere have fallen all the ranges of
song, both on the mainland, nurse of young kine, and among the isles;

first, a delight of men, couched by the Cynthian Hill in the rocky island,
in sea-girt Delos&mdash;on either hand the black wave drives landward
at the word of the shrill winds&mdash;whence arising thou art Lord over
all mortals?</p>
<p>Among them that dwell in Crete, and the people of Athens, and isle
&AElig;gina, and Eub&oelig;a famed for fleets, and &AElig;g&aelig; and
Peiresi&aelig;, and Peparethus by the sea-strand, and Thracian Athos,

a city of Meropian men, and steep Cnidos, and windy Carpathus, Naxos
and Paros, and rocky Rheneia&mdash;so far in travail with the Archer
God went Leto, seeking if perchance any land would build a house for
her son.</p>
<p>But the lands trembled sore, and were adread, and none, nay not the
richest, dared to welcome Ph&oelig;bus, not till Lady Leto set foot
on Delos, and speaking winged words besought her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delos, would that thou wert minded to be the seat of my Son,
Ph&oelig;bus Apollo, and to let build him therein a rich temple!&nbsp;
No other God will touch thee, nor none will honour thee, for methinks
thou art not to be well seen in cattle or in sheep, in fruit or grain,
nor wilt thou grow plants unnumbered.&nbsp; But wert thou to possess
a temple of Apollo the Far-darter; then would all men bring thee hecatombs,
gathering to thee, and ever wilt thou have savour of sacrifice . . .
from others&rsquo; hands, albeit thy soil is poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus spoke she, and Delos was glad and answered her saying: <!-- page 107--><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Leto, daughter most renowned of mighty C&oelig;us, right gladly
would I welcome the birth of the Archer Prince, for verily of me there
goes an evil report among men, and thus would I wax mightiest of renown.&nbsp;
But at this Word, Leto, I tremble, nor will I hide it from thee, for
the saying is that Apollo will be mighty of mood, and mightily will
lord it over mortals and immortals far and wide over the earth, the
grain-giver.&nbsp; Therefore, I deeply dread in heart and soul lest,
when first he looks upon the sunlight, he disdain my island, for rocky
of soil am I, and spurn me with his feet and drive me down in the gulfs
of the salt sea.&nbsp; Then should a great sea-wave wash mightily above
my head for ever, but he will fare to another land, which so pleases
him, to fashion him a temple and groves of trees.&nbsp; But in me would
many-footed sea-beasts and black seals make their chambers securely,
no men dwelling by me.&nbsp; Nay, still, if thou hast the heart, Goddess,
to swear a great oath that here first he will build a beautiful temple,
to be the shrine <!-- page 108--><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>oracular
of men&mdash;thereafter among all men let him raise him shrines, since
his renown shall be the widest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake she, but Leto swore the great oath of the Gods:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear witness, Earth, and the wide heaven above, and dropping
water of Styx&mdash;the greatest oath and the most dread among the blessed
Gods&mdash;that verily here shall ever be the fragrant altar and the
portion of Apollo, and thee will he honour above all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had sworn and done that oath, then Delos was glad in the
birth of the Archer Prince.&nbsp; But Leto, for nine days and nine nights
continually was pierced with pangs of child-birth beyond all hope.&nbsp;
With her were all the Goddesses, the goodliest, Dione and Rheia, and
Ichn&aelig;an Themis, and Amphitrite of the moaning sea, and the other
deathless ones&mdash;save white-armed Hera.&nbsp; Alone she wotted not
of it, Eilithyia, the helper in difficult travail.&nbsp; For she sat
on the crest of Olympus beneath the golden clouds, by the wile of white-armed
Hera, <!-- page 109--><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>who held her
afar in jealous grudge, because even then fair-tressed Leto was about
bearing her strong and noble son.</p>
<p>But the Goddesses sent forth Iris from the fair-stablished isle,
to bring Eilithyia, promising her a great necklet, golden with amber
studs, nine cubits long.&nbsp; Iris they bade to call Eilithyia apart
from white-armed Hera, lest even then the words of Hera might turn her
from her going.&nbsp; But wind-footed swift Iris heard, and fleeted
forth, and swiftly she devoured the space between.&nbsp; So soon as
she came to steep Olympus, the dwelling of the Gods, she called forth
Eilithyia from hall to door, and spake winged words, even all that the
Goddesses of Olympian mansions had bidden her.&nbsp; Thereby she won
the heart in Eilithyia&rsquo;s breast, and forth they fared, like timid
wild doves in their going.</p>
<p>Even when Eilithyia, the helper in sore travailing, set foot in Delos,
then labour took hold on Leto, and a passion to bring to the birth.&nbsp;
Around a palm tree she cast <!-- page 110--><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>her
arms, and set her knees on the soft meadow, while earth beneath smiled,
and forth leaped the babe to light, and all the Goddesses raised a cry.&nbsp;
Then, great Ph&oelig;bus, the Goddesses washed thee in fair water, holy
and purely, and wound thee in white swaddling bands, delicate, new woven,
with a golden girdle round thee.&nbsp; Nor did his mother suckle Apollo
the golden-sworded, but Themis with immortal hands first touched his
lips with nectar and sweet ambrosia, while Leto rejoiced, in that she
had borne her strong son, the bearer of the bow.</p>
<p>Then Ph&oelig;bus, as soon as thou hadst tasted the food of Paradise,
the golden bands were not proof against thy pantings, nor bonds could
bind thee, but all their ends were loosened.&nbsp; Straightway among
the Goddesses spoke Ph&oelig;bus Apollo: &ldquo;Mine be the dear lyre
and bended bow, and I will utter to men the unerring counsel of Zeus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So speaking, he began to fare over the wide ways of earth, Ph&oelig;bus
of the locks <!-- page 111--><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>unshorn,
Ph&oelig;bus the Far-darter.&nbsp; Thereon all the Goddesses were in
amaze, and all Delos blossomed with gold, as when a hilltop is heavy
with woodland flowers, beholding the child of Zeus and Leto, and glad
because the God had chosen her wherein to set his home, beyond mainland
and isles, and loved her most at heart.</p>
<p>But thyself, O Prince of the Silver Bow, far-darting Apollo, didst
now pass over rocky Cynthus, now wander among temples and men.&nbsp;
Many are thy fanes and groves, and dear are all the headlands, and high
peaks of lofty hills, and rivers flowing onward to the sea; but with
Delos, Ph&oelig;bus, art thou most delighted at heart, where the long-robed
Ionians gather in thine honour, with children and shame-fast wives.&nbsp;
Mindful of thee they delight thee with boxing, and dances, and minstrelsy
in their games.&nbsp; Who so then encountered them at the gathering
of the Ionians, would say that they are exempt from eld and death, beholding
them so gracious, and would be glad at heart, looking on the <!-- page 112--><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>men
and fair-girdled women, and their much wealth, and their swift galleys.&nbsp;
Moreover, there is this great marvel of renown imperishable, the Delian
damsels, hand-maidens of the Far-darter.&nbsp; They, when first they
have hymned Apollo, and next Leto and Artemis the Archer, then sing
in memory of the men and women of old time, enchanting the tribes of
mortals.&nbsp; And they are skilled to mimic the notes and dance music
of all men, so that each would say himself were singing, so well woven
is their fair chant.</p>
<p>But now come, be gracious, Apollo, be gracious, Artemis; and ye maidens
all, farewell, but remember me even in time to come, when any of earthly
men, yea, any stranger that much hath seen and much endured, comes hither
and asks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maidens, who is the sweetest to you of singers here conversant,
and in whose song are ye most glad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then do you all with one voice make answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blind man is he, and he dwells in <!-- page 113--><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>rocky
Chios; his songs will ever have the mastery, ay, in all time to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I shall bear my renown of you as far as I wander over earth to
the fairest cities of men, and they will believe my report, for my word
is true.&nbsp; But, for me, never shall I cease singing of Apollo of
the Silver Bow, the Far-darter, whom fair-tressed Leto bore.</p>
<p>O Prince, Lycia is thine, and pleasant M&aelig;onia, and Miletus,
a winsome city by the sea, and thou, too, art the mighty lord of sea-washed
Delos.</p>
<h3>THE FOUNDING OF DELPHI</h3>
<p>The son of glorious Leto fares harping on his hollow harp to rocky
Pytho, clad in his fragrant raiment that waxes not old, and beneath
the golden plectrum winsomely sounds his lyre.&nbsp; Thence from earth
to Olympus, fleet as thought, he goes to the House of Zeus, into the
Consistory of the other Gods, and anon the Immortals bethink them of
harp and minstrelsy.&nbsp; And all the <!-- page 114--><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>Muses
together with sweet voice in antiphonal chant replying, sing of the
imperishable gifts of the Gods, and the sufferings of men, all that
they endure from the hands of the undying Gods, lives witless and helpless,
men unavailing to find remede for death or buckler against old age.&nbsp;
Then the fair-tressed Graces and boon Hours, and Harmonia, and Hebe,
and Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, dance, holding each by the wrist the
other&rsquo;s hand, while among them sings one neither unlovely, nor
of body contemptible, but divinely tall and fair, Artemis the Archer,
nurtured with Apollo.&nbsp; Among them sport Ares, and the keen-eyed
Bane of Argos, while Ph&oelig;bus Apollo steps high and disposedly,
playing the lyre, and the light issues round him from twinkling feet
and fair-woven raiment.&nbsp; But all they are glad, seeing him so high
of heart, Leto of the golden tresses, and Zeus the Counsellor, beholding
their dear son as he takes his pastime among the deathless Gods.</p>
<p>How shall I hymn thee aright, howbeit <!-- page 115--><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>thou
art, in sooth, not hard to hymn?&nbsp; Shall I sing of thee in love
and dalliance; how thou wentest forth to woo the maiden Azanian, with
Ischys, peer of Gods, and Elation&rsquo;s son of the goodly steeds,
or with Phorbas, son of Triopes, or Amarynthus, or how with Leucippus
and Leucippus&rsquo; wife, thyself on foot, he in the chariot . . .?
<a name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115">{115}</a>&nbsp; Or
how first, seeking a place of oracle for men, thou camest down to earth,
far-darting Apollo?</p>
<p>On Pieria first didst thou descend from Olympus, and pass by Lacmus,
and Emathia, and Enien&aelig;, and through Perrh&aelig;bia, and speedily
camest to Iolcus, and alight on Cen&aelig;um in Eub&oelig;a, renowned
for galleys.&nbsp; On the Lelantian plain thou stoodest, but it pleased
thee not there to stablish a temple and a grove.&nbsp; Thence thou didst
cross Euripus, far-darting Apollo, and fare up the green hill divine,
and thence camest speedily to Mycalessus and Teumesos of the bedded
meadow grass, and thence to the place of woodclad Thebe, for as yet
no mortals dwelt <!-- page 116--><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>in
Holy Thebe, nor yet were paths nor ways along Thebe&rsquo;s wheat-bearing
plain, but all was wild wood.</p>
<p>Thence forward journeying, Apollo, thou camest to Onchestus, the
bright grove of Poseidon.&nbsp; There the new-broken colt takes breath
again, weary though he be with dragging the goodly chariot; and to earth,
skilled though he be, leaps down the charioteer, and fares on foot,
while the horses for a while rattle along the empty car, with the reins
on their necks, and if the car be broken in the grove of trees, their
masters tend them there, and tilt the car and let it lie.&nbsp; Such
is the rite from of old, and they pray to the King Poseidon, while the
chariot is the God&rsquo;s portion to keep.</p>
<p>Thence faring forward, far-darting Apollo, thou didst win to Cephisus
of the fair streams, that from Lil&aelig;a pours down his beautiful
waters, which crossing, Far-darter, and passing Ocalea of the towers,
thou camest thereafter to grassy Haliartus.&nbsp; Then didst thou set
foot on Telphusa, and to thee the land seemed <!-- page 117--><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>exceeding
good wherein to stablish a temple and a grove.</p>
<p>Beside Telphusa didst thou stand, and spake to her: &ldquo;Telphusa,
here methinketh to stablish a fair temple, an oracle for men, who, ever
seeking for the word of sooth, will bring me hither perfect hecatombs,
even they that dwell in the rich isle of Pelops, and all they of the
mainland and sea-girt islands.&nbsp; To them all shall I speak the decree
unerring, rendering oracles within my rich temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake Ph&oelig;bus, and thoroughly marked out the foundations,
right long and wide.&nbsp; But at the sight the heart of Telphusa waxed
wroth, and she spake her word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ph&oelig;bus, far-darting Prince, a word shall I set in thy
heart.&nbsp; Here thinkest thou to stablish a goodly temple, to be a
place of oracle for men, that ever will bring thee hither perfect hecatombs&mdash;nay,
but this will I tell thee, and do thou lay it up in thine heart.&nbsp;
The never-ending din of swift steeds will be a weariness to thee, and
the <!-- page 118--><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>watering of mules
from my sacred springs.&nbsp; There men will choose rather to regard
the well-wrought chariots, and the stamping of the swift-footed steeds,
than thy great temple and much wealth therein.&nbsp; But an if thou&mdash;that
art greater and better than I, O Prince, and thy strength is most of
might&mdash;if thou wilt listen to me, in Crisa build thy fane beneath
a glade of Parnassus.&nbsp; There neither will goodly chariots ring,
nor wilt thou be vexed with stamping of swift steeds about thy well-builded
altar, but none the less shall the renowned tribes of men bring their
gifts to Iep&aelig;on, and delighted shalt thou gather the sacrifices
of them who dwell around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith she won over the heart of the Far-darter, even that to
Telphusa herself should be honour in that land, and not to the Far-darter.</p>
<p>Thenceforward didst thou fare, far-darting Apollo, and camest to
the city of the overweening Phlegy&aelig;, that reckless of Zeus dwelt
there in a goodly glade by the Cephisian mere.&nbsp; Thence fleetly
didst thou speed to <!-- page 119--><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>the
ridge of the hills, and camest to Crisa beneath snowy Parnassus, to
a knoll that faced westward, but above it hangs a cliff, and a hollow
dell runs under, rough with wood, and even there Prince Ph&oelig;bus
Apollo deemed well to build a goodly temple, and spake, saying: &ldquo;Here
methinketh to stablish a right fair temple, to be a place oracular to
men, that shall ever bring me hither goodly hecatombs, both they that
dwell in rich Peloponnesus, and they of the mainland and sea-girt isles,
seeking here the word of sooth; to them all shall I speak the decree
unerring, rendering oracles within my wealthy shrine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So speaking, Ph&oelig;bus Apollo marked out the foundations, right
long and wide, and thereon Trophonius and Agamedes laid the threshold
of stone, the sons of Erginus, dear to the deathless Gods.&nbsp; But
round all the countless tribes of men built a temple with wrought stones
to be famous for ever in song.</p>
<p>Hard by is a fair-flowing stream, and there, with an arrow from his
strong bow, <!-- page 120--><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>did the
Prince, the son of Zeus, slay the Dragoness, mighty and huge, a wild
Etin, that was wont to wreak many woes on earthly men, on themselves,
and their straight-stepping flocks, so dread a bane was she.</p>
<p>[This Dragoness it was that took from golden-throned Hera and reared
the dread Typhaon, not to be dealt with, a bane to mortals.&nbsp; Him
did Hera bear, upon a time, in wrath with father Zeus, whenas Cronides
brought forth from his head renowned Athene.&nbsp; Straightway lady
Hera was angered, and spake among the assembled Gods:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, ye Gods, and Goddesses all, how cloud-collecting
Zeus is first to begin the dishonouring of me, though he made me his
wife in honour.&nbsp; And now, apart from me, he has brought forth grey-eyed
Athene who excels among all the blessed Immortals.&nbsp; But he was
feeble from the birth, among all the Gods, my son Heph&aelig;stos, lame
and withered of foot, whom I myself lifted in my hands, and cast into
the wide sea.&nbsp; But the daughter of Nereus, Thetis of the silver
feet, <!-- page 121--><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>received him
and nurtured him among her sisters.&nbsp; Would that she had done other
grace to the blessed Immortals!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou evil one of many wiles, what other wile devisest thou?&nbsp;
How hadst thou the heart now alone to bear grey-eyed Athene?&nbsp; Could
I not have borne her?&nbsp; But none the less would she have been called
thine among the Immortals, who hold the wide heaven.&nbsp; Take heed
now, that I devise not for thee some evil to come.&nbsp; Yea, now shall
I use arts whereby a child of mine shall be born, excelling among the
immortal Gods, without dishonouring thy sacred bed or mine, for verily
to thy bed I will not come, but far from thee will nurse my grudge against
the Immortal Gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake she, and withdrew from among the Gods with angered heart.&nbsp;
Right so she made her prayer, the ox-eyed lady Hera, striking the earth
with her hand flatlings, <a name="citation121"></a><a href="#footnote121">{121}</a>
and spake her word: <!-- page 122--><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me now, Earth, and wide Heavens above, and ye Gods
called Titans, dwelling beneath earth in great Tartarus, ye from whom
spring Gods and men!&nbsp; List to me now, all of you, and give me a
child apart from Zeus, yet nothing inferior to him in might, nay, stronger
than he, as much as far-seeing Zeus is mightier than Cronus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake she, and smote the ground with her firm hand.&nbsp; Then
Earth, the nurse of life, was stirred, and Hera, beholding it, was glad
at heart, for she deemed that her prayer would be accomplished.&nbsp;
From that hour for a full year she never came to the bed of wise Zeus,
nor to her throne adorned, whereon she was wont to sit, planning deep
counsel, but dwelling in her temples, the homes of Prayers, she took
joy in her sacrifices, the ox-eyed lady Hera.</p>
<p>Now when her months and days were fulfilled, the year revolving,
and the seasons in their course coming round, she bare a birth like
neither Gods nor mortals, the dread Typhaon, not to be dealt with, a
bane of men. <!-- page 123--><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span> Him
now she took, the ox-eyed lady Hera, and carried and gave to the Dragoness,
to bitter nurse a bitter fosterling, who received him, that ever wrought
many wrongs among the renowned tribes of men.]</p>
<p>Whosoever met the Dragoness, on him would she bring the day of destiny,
before the Prince, far-darting Apollo, loosed at her the destroying
shaft; then writhing in strong anguish, and mightily panting she lay,
rolling about the land.&nbsp; Dread and dire was the din, as she writhed
hither and thither through the wood, and gave up the ghost, and Ph&oelig;bus
spoke his malison:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There do thou rot upon the fruitful earth; no longer shalt
thou, at least, live to be the evil bane of mortals that eat the fruit
of the fertile soil, and hither shall bring perfect hecatombs.&nbsp;
Surely from thee neither shall Typh&oelig;us, nay, nor Chim&aelig;ra
of the evil name, shield death that layeth low, but here shall black
earth and bright Hyperion make thee waste away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he spake in malison, and darkness <!-- page 124--><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>veiled
her eyes, and there the sacred strength of the sun did waste her quite
away.&nbsp; Whence now the place is named Pytho, and men call the Prince
&ldquo;Pythian&rdquo; for that deed, for even there the might of the
swift sun made corrupt the monster. <a name="citation124"></a><a href="#footnote124">{124}</a></p>
<p>Then Ph&oelig;bus Apollo was ware in his heart that the fair-flowing
spring, Telphusa, had beguiled him, and in wrath he went to her, and
swiftly came, and standing close by her, spoke his word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telphusa, thou wert not destined to beguile my mind, nor keep
the winsome lands and pour forth thy fair waters.&nbsp; Nay, here shall
my honour also dwell, not thine alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he spoke, and
overset a rock, with a shower of stones, and hid her streams, the Prince,
far-darting Apollo.&nbsp; And he made an altar in a grove of trees,
hard by the fair-flowing stream, where all men name him in prayer, &ldquo;the
Prince Telphusian,&rdquo; for that he shamed the streams of sacred Telphusa.&nbsp;
Then Ph&oelig;bus Apollo considered in his <!-- page 125--><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>heart
what men he should bring in to be his ministers, and to serve him in
rocky Pytho.&nbsp; While he was pondering on this, he beheld a swift
ship on the wine-dark sea, and aboard her many men and good, Cretans
from Minoan Cnossus, such as do sacrifice to the God, and speak the
doom of Ph&oelig;bus Apollo of the Golden Sword, what word soever he
utters of sooth from the daphne in the dells of Parnassus.&nbsp; For
barter and wealth they were sailing in the black ship to sandy Pylos,
and the Pylian men.&nbsp; Anon Ph&oelig;bus Apollo set forth to meet
them, leaping into the sea upon the swift ship in the guise of a dolphin,
and there he lay, a portent great and terrible.</p>
<p>[Of the crew, whosoever sought in heart to comprehend what he was
. . .&nbsp; On all sides he kept swaying to and fro, and shaking the
timbers of the galley.]&nbsp; But all they sat silent and in fear aboard
the ship, nor loosed the sheets, nor the sail of the black-prowed galley;
nay, even as they had first set the sails so they voyaged onward, the
strong <!-- page 126--><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>south-wind
speeding on the vessel from behind.&nbsp; First they rounded Malea,
and passed the Laconian land and came to Helos, a citadel by the sea,
and T&aelig;narus, the land of Helios, that is the joy of mortals, where
ever feed the deep-fleeced flocks of Prince Helios, and there hath he
his glad demesne.&nbsp; There the crew thought to stay the galley, and
land and consider of the marvel, and see whether that strange thing
will abide on the deck of the hollow ship or leap again into the swell
of the fishes&rsquo; home.&nbsp; But the well-wrought ship did not obey
the rudder, but kept ever on her way beyond rich Peloponnesus, Prince
Apollo lightly guiding it by the gale.&nbsp; So accomplishing her course
she came to Arene, and pleasant Arguphea, and Thryon, the ford of Alpheius,
and well-builded Aepu, and sandy Pylos, and the Pylian men, and ran
by Crounoi, and Chalcis, and Dyme, and holy Elis, where the Epeians
bear sway.&nbsp; Then rejoicing in the breeze of Zeus, she was making
for Pher&aelig;, when to them out of the clouds showed <!-- page 127--><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>forth
the steep ridge of Ithaca, and Dulichium, and Same, and wooded Zacynthus.&nbsp;
Anon when she had passed beyond all Peloponnesus, there straightway,
off Crisa, appeared the wide sound, that bounds rich Peloponnesus.&nbsp;
Then came on the west wind, clear and strong, by the counsel of Zeus,
blowing hard out of heaven, that the running ship might swiftest accomplish
her course over the salt water of the sea.</p>
<p>Backward then they sailed towards the Dawn and the sun, and the Prince
was their guide, Apollo, son of Zeus.&nbsp; Then came they to far-seen
Crisa, the land of vines, into the haven, while the sea-faring ship
beached herself on the shingle.&nbsp; Then from the ship leaped the
Prince, far-darting Apollo, like a star at high noon, while the gledes
of fire flew from him, and the splendour flashed to the heavens.&nbsp;
Into his inmost Holy Place he went through the precious tripods, and
in the midst he kindled a flame showering forth his shafts, and the
splendour filled all Crisa, <a name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127">{127}</a>
and the <!-- page 128--><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>wives of
the Cris&aelig;ans, and their fair-girdled daughters raised a wail at
the rushing flight of Ph&oelig;bus, for great fear fell upon all.&nbsp;
Thence again to the galley he set forth and flew, fleet as a thought,
in shape a man lusty and strong, in his first youth, his locks swathing
his wide shoulders.&nbsp; Anon he spake to the seamen winged words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangers, who are ye, whence sail ye the wet ways?&nbsp;
Is it after merchandise, or do ye wander at adventure, over the salt
sea, as sea-robbers use, that roam staking their own lives, and bearing
bane to men of strange speech?&nbsp; Why sit ye thus adread, not faring
forth on the land, nor slackening the gear of your black ship?&nbsp;
Sure this is the wont of toilsome mariners, when they come from the
deep to the land in their black ship, foredone with labour, and anon
a longing for sweet food seizes their hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake he, and put courage in their breasts, and the leader of
the Cretans answered him, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranger, behold thou art no whit like <!-- page 129--><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>unto
mortal men in shape or growth, but art a peer of the Immortals, wherefore
all hail, and grace be thine, and all good things at the hands of the
Gods.&nbsp; Tell me then truly that I may know indeed, what people is
this, what land, what mortals dwell here?&nbsp; Surely with our thoughts
set on another goal we sailed the great sea to Pylos from Crete, whence
we boast our lineage; but now it is hither that we have come, maugre
our wills, with our galley&mdash;another path and other ways&mdash;we
longing to return, but some God has led us all unwilling to this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the far-darting Apollo answered them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangers, who dwelt aforetime round wooded Cnossus, never
again shall ye return each to his pleasant city and his own house, and
his wife, but here shall ye hold my rich temple, honoured by multitudes
of men.&nbsp; Lo! I am the son of Zeus, and name myself Apollo, and
hither have I brought you over the great gulf of the sea, with no evil
intent.&nbsp; Nay, here shall ye possess my rich temple, <!-- page 130--><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>held
highest in honour among all men, and ye shall know the counsels of the
Immortals, by whose will ye shall ever be held in renown.&nbsp; But
now come, and instantly obey my word.&nbsp; First lower the sails, and
loose the sheets, and then beach the black ship on the land, taking
forth the wares and gear of the trim galley, and build ye an altar on
the strand of the sea.&nbsp; Thereon kindle fire, and sprinkle above
in sacrifice the white barley-flour, and thereafter pray, standing around
the altar.&nbsp; And whereas I first, in the misty sea, sprang aboard
the swift ship in the guise of a dolphin, therefore pray to me as Apollo
Delphinius, while mine shall ever be the Delphian altar seen from afar.&nbsp;
Then take ye supper beside the swift black ship, and pour libations
to the blessed Gods who hold Olympus.&nbsp; But when ye have dismissed
the desire of sweet food then with me do ye come, singing the P&aelig;an,
till ye win that place where ye shall possess the rich temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake he, while they heard and obeyed <!-- page 131--><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>eagerly.&nbsp;
First they lowered the sails, loosing the sheets, and lowering the mast
by the forestays, they laid it in the mast-stead, and themselves went
forth on the strand of the sea.&nbsp; Then forth from the salt sea to
the mainland they dragged the fleet ship high up on the sands, laying
long sleepers thereunder, and they builded an altar on the sea-strand,
and lit fire thereon, scattering above white barley-flour in sacrifice,
and, standing around the altar, they prayed as the God commanded.&nbsp;
Anon they took supper beside the fleet black ship, and poured forth
libations to the blessed Gods who hold Olympus.&nbsp; But when they
had dismissed the desire of meat and drink they set forth on their way,
and the Prince Apollo guided them, harp in hand, and sweetly he harped,
faring with high and goodly strides.&nbsp; Dancing in his train the
Cretans followed to Pytho, and the P&aelig;an they were chanting, the
p&aelig;ans of the Cretans in whose breasts the Muse hath put honey-sweet
song.&nbsp; All unwearied they strode to the hill, and swiftly were
got to <!-- page 132--><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Parnassus
and a winsome land, where they were to dwell, honoured of many among
men.</p>
<p>Apollo guided them, and showed his holy shrine and rich temple, and
the spirit was moved in their breasts, and the captain of the Cretans
spake, and asked the God, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince, since thou hast led us far from friends and our own
country, for so it pleases thee, how now shall we live, we pray thee
tell us.&nbsp; This fair land bears not vines, nor is rich in meadows,
wherefrom we might live well, and minister to men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, smiling, Apollo, the son of Zeus, spoke to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolish ones, enduring hearts, who desire cares, and sore
toil, and all straits!&nbsp; A light word will I speak to you, do ye
consider it.&nbsp; Let each one of you, knife in right hand, be ever
slaughtering sheep that in abundance shall ever be yours, all the flocks
that the renowned tribes of men bring hither to me.&nbsp; Yours it is
to guard my temple, and receive <!-- page 133--><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>the
tribes of men that gather hither, doing, above all, as my will enjoins.&nbsp;
But if any vain word be spoken, or vain deed wrought, or violence after
the manner of mortal men, then shall others be your masters, and hold
you in thraldom for ever. <a name="citation133"></a><a href="#footnote133">{133}</a>&nbsp;
I have spoken all, do thou keep it in thy heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even so, fare thou well, son of Zeus and Leto, but I shall remember

<p>Of Hermes sing, O Muse, the son of Zeus and Maia, Lord of Cyllene,
and Arcadia rich in sheep, the fortune-bearing Herald of the Gods, him
whom Maia bore, the fair-tressed nymph, that lay in the arms of Zeus;
a shamefaced nymph was she, shunning the assembly of the blessed Gods,
dwelling within a shadowy cave.&nbsp; Therein was Cronion wont to embrace
the fair-tressed nymph in the deep of night, when sweet sleep held white-armed
Hera, the immortal Gods knowing it not, nor mortal men.</p>
<p>But when the mind of great Zeus was fulfilled, and over <i>her</i>
the tenth moon stood in the sky, the babe was born to light, and all
was made manifest; yea, then she bore a child of many a wile and cunning
counsel, a robber, a driver <!-- page 135--><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>of
the kine, a captain of raiders, a watcher of the night, a thief of the
gates, who soon should show forth deeds renowned among the deathless
Gods.&nbsp; Born in the dawn, by midday well he harped, and in the evening
stole the cattle of Apollo the Far-darter, on that fourth day of the
month wherein lady Maia bore him.&nbsp; Who, when he leaped from the
immortal knees of his mother, lay not long in the sacred cradle, but
sped forth to seek the cattle of Apollo, crossing the threshold of the
high-roofed cave.&nbsp; There found he a tortoise, and won endless delight,
for lo, it was Hermes that first made of the tortoise a minstrel.&nbsp;
The creature met him at the outer door, as she fed on the rich grass
in front of the dwelling, waddling along, at sight whereof the luck-bringing
son of Zeus laughed, and straightway spoke, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lo, a lucky omen for me, not by me to be mocked!&nbsp; Hail,
darling and dancer, friend of the feast, welcome art thou! whence gatst
thou the gay garment, a speckled shell, thou, a mountain-dwelling tortoise?&nbsp;
Nay, I will <!-- page 136--><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>carry
thee within, and a boon shalt thou be to me, not by me to be scorned,
nay, thou shalt first serve my turn.&nbsp; Best it is to bide at home,
since danger is abroad.&nbsp; Living shalt thou be a spell against ill
witchery, and dead, then a right sweet music-maker.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="Hermes making the lyre.  Bronze relief in the British Museum (Fourth Century B.C.)" src="images/lang136s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>So spake he, and raising in both hands the tortoise, went back within
the dwelling, bearing the glad treasure.&nbsp; Then he choked the creature,
and with a gouge of grey iron he scooped out the marrow of the hill
tortoise.&nbsp; And as a swift thought wings through the breast of one
that crowding cares are haunting, or as bright glances fleet from the
eyes, so swiftly devised renowned Hermes both deed and word.&nbsp; He
cut to measure stalks of reed, and fixed them in through holes bored
in the stony shell of the tortoise, and cunningly stretched round it
the hide of an ox, and put in the horns of the lyre, and to both he
fitted the bridge, and stretched seven harmonious chords of sheep-gut.
<a name="citation136"></a><a href="#footnote136">{136}</a> <!-- page 137--><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span></p>
<p>Then took he his treasure, when he had fashioned it, and touched
the strings in turn with the <i>plectrum</i>, and wondrously it sounded
under his hand, and fair sang the God to the notes, improvising his
chant as he played, like lads exchanging taunts at festivals.&nbsp;
Of Zeus Cronides and fair-sandalled Maia he sang how they had lived
in loving dalliance, and he told out the tale of his begetting, and
sang the handmaids and the goodly halls of the Nymph, and the tripods
in the house, and the store of cauldrons.&nbsp; So then he sang, but
dreamed of other deeds; then bore he the hollow lyre and laid it in
the sacred cradle, then, in longing for flesh of kine he sped from the
fragrant hall to a place of outlook, with such a design in his heart
<!-- page 138--><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>as reiving men pursue
in the dark of night.</p>
<p>The sun had sunk down beneath earth into ocean, with horses and chariot,
when Hermes came running to the shadowy hills of Pieria, where the deathless
kine of the blessed Gods had ever their haunt; there fed they on the
fair unshorn meadows.&nbsp; From their number did the keen-sighted Argeiphontes,
son of Maia, cut off fifty loud-lowing kine, and drove them hither and
thither over the sandy land, reversing their tracks, and, mindful of
his cunning, confused the hoof-marks, the front behind, the hind in
front, and himself fared down again.&nbsp; Straightway he wove sandals
on the sea-sand (things undreamed he wrought, works wonderful, unspeakable)
mingling myrtle twigs and tamarisk, then binding together a bundle of
the fresh young wood, he shrewdly fastened it for light sandals beneath
his feet, leaves and all, <a name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138">{138}</a>&mdash;brushwood
that the <!-- page 139--><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>renowned
slayer of Argos had plucked on his way from Pieria [being, as he was,
in haste, down the long way].</p>
<p>Then an old man that was labouring a fruitful vineyard, marked the
God faring down to the plain through grassy Onchestus, and to him spoke
first the son of renowned Maia:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old man that bowest thy shoulders over thy hoeing, verily
thou shalt have wine enough when all these vines are bearing. . . .
See thou, and see not; hear thou, and hear not; be silent, so long as
naught of thine is harmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith he drave on together the sturdy heads of cattle.&nbsp;
And over many a shadowy hill, and through echoing corries and flowering
plains drave renowned Hermes.&nbsp; Then stayed for the more part his
darkling ally, the sacred Night, and swiftly came morning when men can
work, and sacred Selene, daughter of Pallas, mighty prince, clomb to
a new place of outlook, and then the strong son of Zeus drave the broad-browed
<!-- page 140--><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>kine of Ph&oelig;bus
Apollo to the river Alpheius.&nbsp; Unwearied they came to the high-roofed
stall and the watering-places in front of the fair meadow.&nbsp; There,
when he had foddered the deep-voiced kine, he herded them huddled together
into the byre, munching lotus and dewy marsh marigold; next brought
he much wood, and set himself to the craft of fire-kindling.&nbsp; Taking
a goodly shoot of the daphne, he peeled it with the knife, fitting it
to his hand, <a name="citation140"></a><a href="#footnote140">{140}</a>
and the hot vapour of smoke arose.&nbsp; [Lo, it was Hermes first who
gave fire, and the fire-sticks.]&nbsp; Then took he many dry faggots,
great plenty, and piled them in the trench, and flame began to break,
sending far the breath of burning fire.&nbsp; And when the force of
renowned Heph&aelig;stus kept the fire aflame, then downward dragged
he, so mighty his strength, two bellowing kine of twisted horn: close
up to the fire he dragged them, and cast them both panting upon their
backs to the ground.&nbsp; [Then <!-- page 141--><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>bending
over them he turned them upwards and cut their throats] . . . task upon
task, and sliced off the fat meat, pierced it with spits of wood, and
broiled it,&mdash;flesh, and chine, the joint of honour, and blood in
the bowels, all together;&mdash;then laid all there in its place.&nbsp;
The hides he stretched out on a broken rock, as even now they are used,
such as are to be enduring: long, and long after that ancient day. <a name="citation141a"></a><a href="#footnote141a">{141a}</a>&nbsp;
Anon glad Hermes dragged the fat portions on to a smooth ledge, and
cut twelve messes sorted out by lot, to each its due meed he gave.&nbsp;
Then a longing for the rite of the sacrifice of flesh came on renowned
Hermes: for the sweet savour irked him, immortal as he was, but not
even so did his strong heart yield. <a name="citation141b"></a><a href="#footnote141b">{141b}</a>
. . .&nbsp; The fat and flesh he placed in the high-roofed stall, the
rest he swiftly raised aloft, a trophy of his reiving, and, gathering
dry faggots, he burned heads and feet entire with the vapour of flame.&nbsp;
Anon <!-- page 142--><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>when the God
had duly finished all, he cast his sandals into the deep swirling pool
of Alpheius, quenched the embers, and all night long spread smooth the
black dust: Selene lighting him with her lovely light.&nbsp; Back to
the crests of Cyllene came the God at dawn, nor blessed God, on that
long way, nor mortal man encountered him; nay, and no dog barked.&nbsp;
Then Hermes, son of Zeus, bearer of boon, bowed his head, and entered
the hall through the hole of the bolt, like mist on the breath of autumn.&nbsp;
Then, standing erect, he sped to the rich inmost chamber of the cave,
lightly treading noiseless on the floor.&nbsp; Quickly to his cradle
came glorious Hermes and wrapped the swaddling bands about his shoulders,
like a witless babe, playing with the wrapper about his knees.&nbsp;
So lay he, guarding his dear lyre at his left hand.&nbsp; But his Goddess
mother the God did not deceive; she spake, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore, thou cunning one, and whence comest thou in the
night, thou clad in shamelessness?&nbsp; Anon, methinks, thou <!-- page 143--><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>wilt
go forth at Apollo&rsquo;s hands with bonds about thy sides that may
not be broken, sooner than be a robber in the glens.&nbsp; Go to, wretch,
thy Father begat thee for a trouble to deathless Gods and mortal men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hermes answered her with words of guile: &ldquo;Mother mine,
why wouldst thou scare me so, as though I were a redeless child, with
little craft in his heart, a trembling babe that dreads his mother&rsquo;s
chidings?&nbsp; Nay, but I will essay the wiliest craft to feed thee
and me for ever.&nbsp; We twain are not to endure to abide here, of
all the deathless Gods alone unapproached with sacrifice and prayer,
as thou commandest.&nbsp; Better it is eternally to be conversant with
Immortals, richly, nobly, well seen in wealth of grain, than to be homekeepers
in a darkling cave.&nbsp; And for honour, I too will have my dues of
sacrifice, even as Apollo.&nbsp; Even if my Father give it me not I
will endeavour, for I am of avail, to be a captain of reivers.&nbsp;
And if the son of renowned Leto make inquest for me, methinks some <!-- page 144--><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>worse
thing will befall him.&nbsp; For to Pytho I will go, to break into his
great house, whence I shall sack goodly tripods and cauldrons enough,
and gold, and gleaming iron, and much raiment.&nbsp; Thyself, if thou
hast a mind, shalt see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So held they converse one with another, the son of Zeus of the &AElig;gis,
and Lady Maia.&nbsp; Then Morning the Daughter of Dawn was arising from
the deep stream of Oceanus, bearing light to mortals, what time Apollo
came to Onchestus in his journeying, the gracious grove, a holy place
of the loud Girdler of the Earth: there he found an old man grazing
his ox, the stay of his vineyard, on the roadside. <a name="citation144"></a><a href="#footnote144">{144}</a>&nbsp;
Him first bespoke the son of renowned Leto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old man, hedger of grassy Onchestus; hither am I come seeking
cattle from Pieria, all the crook-horned kine out of my herd: my black
bull was wont to graze apart from the rest, and my four bright-eyed
<!-- page 145--><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>hounds followed,
four of them, wise as men and all of one mind.&nbsp; These were left,
the hounds and the bull, a marvel; but the kine wandered away from their
soft meadow and sweet pasture, at the going down of the sun.&nbsp; Tell
me, thou old man of ancient days, if thou hast seen any man faring after
these cattle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then to him the old man spake and answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend, hard it were to tell all that a man may see: for
many wayfarers go by, some full of ill intent, and some of good: and
it is difficult to be certain regarding each.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the
whole day long till sunset I was digging about my vineyard plot, and
methought I marked&mdash;but I know not surely&mdash;a child that went
after the horned kine; right young he was, and held a staff, and kept
going from side to side, and backwards he drove the kine, their faces
fronting him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake the old man, but Apollo heard, and went fleeter on his path.&nbsp;
Then marked he a bird long of wing, and anon he knew <!-- page 146--><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>that
the thief had been the son of Zeus Cronion.&nbsp; Swiftly sped the Prince,
Apollo, son of Zeus, to goodly Pylos, seeking the shambling kine, while
his broad shoulders were swathed in purple cloud.&nbsp; Then the Far-darter
marked the tracks, and spake:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, a great marvel mine eyes behold!&nbsp; These be the
tracks of high-horned kine, but all are turned back to the meadow of
asphodel.&nbsp; But these are not the footsteps of a man, nay, nor of
a woman, nor of grey wolves, nor bears, nor lions, nor, methinks, of
a shaggy-maned Centaur, whosoever with fleet feet makes such mighty
strides!&nbsp; Dread to see they are that backwards go, more dread they
that go forwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So speaking, the Prince sped on, Apollo, son of Zeus.&nbsp; To the
Cyllenian hill he came, that is clad in forests, to the deep shadow
of the hollow rock, where the deathless nymph brought forth the child
of Zeus Cronion.&nbsp; A fragrance sweet was spread about the goodly
hill, and many tall sheep were grazing the <!-- page 147--><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>grass.&nbsp;
Thence he went fleetly over the stone threshold into the dusky cave,
even Apollo, the Far-darter.</p>
<p>Now when the son of Zeus and Maia beheld Apollo thus in wrath for
his kine, he sank down within his fragrant swaddling bands, being covered
as piled embers of burnt tree-roots are covered by thick ashes, so Hermes
coiled himself up, when he saw the Far-darter; and curled himself, feet,
head, and hands, into small space [summoning sweet sleep], though of
a verity wide awake, and his tortoise-shell he kept beneath his armpit.&nbsp;
But the son of Zeus and Leto marked them well, the lovely mountain nymph
and her dear son, a little babe, all wrapped in cunning wiles.&nbsp;
Gazing round all the chamber of the vasty dwelling, Apollo opened three
aumbries with the shining key; full were they of nectar and glad ambrosia,
and much gold and silver lay within, and much raiment of the Nymph,
purple and glistering, such as are within the dwellings of the mighty
Gods.&nbsp; Anon, when <!-- page 148--><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>he
had searched out the chambers of the great hall, the son of Leto spake
to renowned Hermes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child, in the cradle lying, tell me straightway of my kine:
or speedily between us twain will be unseemly strife.&nbsp; For I will
seize thee and cast thee into murky Tartarus, into the darkness of doom
where none is of avail.&nbsp; Nor shall thy father or mother redeem
thee to the light: nay, under earth shalt thou roam, a reiver among
folk fordone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hermes answered with words of craft: &ldquo;Apollo, what ungentle
word hast thou spoken?&nbsp; And is it thy cattle of the homestead thou
comest here to seek?&nbsp; I saw them not, heard not of them, gave ear
to no word of them: of them I can tell no tidings, nor win the fee of
him who tells.&nbsp; Not like a lifter of cattle, a stalwart man, am
I: no task is this of mine: hitherto I have other cares; sleep, and
mother&rsquo;s milk, and about my shoulders swaddling bands, and warmed
baths.&nbsp; Let none know whence this feud arose!&nbsp; And verily
great marvel among the <!-- page 149--><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>Immortals
it would be, that a new-born child should cross the threshold after
kine of the homestead; a silly rede of thine.&nbsp; Yesterday was I
born, my feet are tender, and rough is the earth below.&nbsp; But if
thou wilt I shall swear the great oath by my father&rsquo;s head, that
neither I myself am to blame, nor have I seen any other thief of thy
kine: be kine what they may, for I know but by hearsay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake he with twinkling eyes, and twisted brows, glancing hither
and thither, with long-drawn whistling breath, hearing Apollo&rsquo;s
word as a vain thing.&nbsp; Then lightly laughing spake Apollo the Far-darter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thou rogue, thou crafty one; verily methinks that many
a time thou wilt break into stablished homes, and by night leave many
a man bare, silently pilling through his house, such is thy speech to-day!&nbsp;
And many herdsmen of the steadings wilt thou vex in the mountain glens,
when in lust for flesh thou comest on the herds and sheep thick of fleece.&nbsp;
Nay come, lest thou sleep <!-- page 150--><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>the
last and longest slumber, come forth from thy cradle, thou companion
of black night!&nbsp; For surely this honour hereafter thou shalt have
among the Immortals, to be called for ever the captain of reivers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake Ph&oelig;bus Apollo, and lifted the child, but even then
strong Argus-bane had his device, and, in the hands of the God, let
forth an Omen, an evil belly-tenant, with tidings of worse, and a speedy
sneeze thereafter.&nbsp; Apollo heard, and dropped renowned Hermes on
the ground, then sat down before him, eager as he was to be gone, chiding
Hermes, and thus he spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take heart, swaddling one, child of Zeus and Maia.&nbsp; By
these thine Omens shall I find anon the sturdy kine, and thou shalt
lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake he, but swiftly arose Cyllenian Hermes, and swiftly fared,
pulling about his ears his swaddling bands that were his shoulder wrapping.&nbsp;
Then spake he:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither bearest thou me, Far-darter, of Gods most vehement?&nbsp;
Is it for wrath about <!-- page 151--><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>thy
kine that thou thus provokest me?&nbsp; Would that the race of kine
might perish, for thy cattle have I not stolen, nor seen another steal,
whatsoever kine may be; I know but by hearsay, I!&nbsp; But let our
suit be judged before Zeus Cronion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now were lone Hermes and the splendid son of Leto point by point
disputing their pleas, Apollo with sure knowledge was righteously seeking
to convict renowned Hermes for the sake of his kine, but he with craft
and cunning words sought to beguile,&mdash;the Cyllenian to beguile
the God of the Silver Bow.&nbsp; But when the wily one found one as
wily, then speedily he strode forward through the sand in front, while
behind came the son of Zeus and Leto.&nbsp; Swiftly they came to the
crests of fragrant Olympus, to father Cronion they came, these goodly
sons of Zeus, for there were set for them the balances of doom.&nbsp;
Quiet was snowy Olympus, but they who know not decay or death were gathering
after gold-throned Dawn.&nbsp; Then stood Hermes and Apollo of the Silver
Bow before <!-- page 152--><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>the knees
of Zeus, the Thunderer, who inquired of his glorious Son, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ph&oelig;bus, whence drivest thou such mighty spoil, a new-born
babe like a Herald?&nbsp; A mighty matter this, to come before the gathering
of the Gods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered him the Prince, Apollo the Far-darter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, anon shalt thou hear no empty tale; tauntest thou
me, as though I were the only lover of booty?&nbsp; This boy have I
found, a finished reiver, in the hills of Cyllene, a long way to wander;
so fine a knave as I know not among Gods or men, of all robbers on earth.&nbsp;
My kine he stole from the meadows, and went driving them at eventide
along the loud sea shores, straight to Pylos.&nbsp; Wondrous were the
tracks, a thing to marvel on, work of a glorious god.&nbsp; For the
black dust showed the tracks of the kine making backward to the mead
of asphodel; but this child intractable fared neither on hands nor feet,
through the sandy land, but this other strange craft had he, <!-- page 153--><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>to
tread the paths as if shod on with oaken shoots. <a name="citation153"></a><a href="#footnote153">{153}</a>&nbsp;
While he drove the kine through a land of sand, right plain to discern
were all the tracks in the dust, but when he had crossed the great tract
of sand, straightway on hard ground his traces and those of the kine
were ill to discern.&nbsp; But a mortal man beheld him, driving straight
to Pylos the cattle broad of brow.&nbsp; Now when he had stalled the
kine in quiet, and confused his tracks on either side the way, he lay
dark as night in his cradle, in the dusk of a shadowy cave.&nbsp; The
keenest eagle could not have spied him, and much he rubbed his eyes,
with crafty purpose, and bluntly spake his word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw not, I heard not aught, nor learned another&rsquo;s
tale; nor tidings could I give, nor win reward of tidings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith Ph&oelig;bus Apollo sat him down, but another tale did
Hermes tell, among the Immortals, addressing Cronion, the master of
all Gods:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Zeus, verily the truth will I tell <!-- page 154--><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>thee:
for true am I, nor know the way of falsehood.&nbsp; To-day at sunrise
came Apollo to our house, seeking his shambling kine.&nbsp; No witnesses
of the Gods brought he, nor no Gods who had seen the fact.&nbsp; But
he bade me declare the thing under duress, threatening oft to cast me
into wide Tartarus, for he wears the tender flower of glorious youth,
but I was born but yesterday, as well himself doth know, and in naught
am I like a stalwart lifter of kine.&nbsp; Believe, for thou givest
thyself out to be my father, that may I never be well if I drove home
the kine, nay, or crossed the threshold.&nbsp; This I say for sooth!&nbsp;
The Sun I greatly revere, and other gods, and Thee I love, and <i>him</i>
I dread.&nbsp; Nay, thyself knowest that I am not to blame; and thereto
I will add a great oath: by these fair-wrought porches of the Gods I
am guiltless, and one day yet I shall avenge me on him for this pitiless
accusation, mighty as he is; but do thou aid the younger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake Cyllenian Argus-bane, and winked, with his wrapping on his
arm: he <!-- page 155--><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>did not cast
it down.&nbsp; But Zeus laughed aloud at the sight of his evil-witted
child, so well and wittily he pled denial about the kine.&nbsp; Then
bade he them both be of one mind, and so seek the cattle, with Hermes
as guide to lead the way, and show without guile where he had hidden
the sturdy kine.&nbsp; The Son of Cronos nodded, and glorious Hermes
obeyed, for lightly persuadeth the counsel of Zeus of the &AElig;gis.</p>
<p>Then sped both of them, the fair children of Zeus, to sandy Pylos,
at the ford of Alpheius, and to the fields they came, and the stall
of lofty roof, where the booty was tended in the season of darkness.&nbsp;
There anon Hermes went to the side of the rocky cave, and began driving
the sturdy cattle into the light.&nbsp; But the son of Leto, glancing
aside, saw the flayed skins on the high rock, and quickly asked renowned
Hermes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wert thou of avail, oh crafty one, to flay two kine; new-born
and childish as thou art?&nbsp; For time to come I dread thy <!-- page 156--><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>might:
no need for thee to be growing long, thou son of Maia!&rdquo; <a name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156">{156}</a></p>
<p>[So spake he, and round his hands twisted strong bands of withes,
but they at his feet were soon intertwined, each with other, and lightly
were they woven over all the kine of the field, by the counsel of thievish
Hermes, but Apollo marvelled at that he saw.]</p>
<p>Then the strong Argus-bane with twinkling glances looked down at
the ground, wishful to hide his purpose.&nbsp; But that harsh son of
renowned Leto, the Far-darter, did he lightly soothe to his will; taking
his lyre in his left hand he tuned it with the <i>plectrum</i>: and
wondrously it rang beneath his hand.&nbsp; Thereat Ph&oelig;bus Apollo
laughed and was glad, and the winsome note passed through to his very
soul as he heard.&nbsp; Then Maia&rsquo;s son took courage, and sweetly
harping with his harp he stood at Apollo&rsquo;s left side, playing
his prelude, and thereon followed his winsome voice. <!-- page 157--><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>
He sang the renowns of the deathless Gods, and the dark Earth, how all
things were at the first, and how each God gat his portion.</p>
<p>To Mnemosyne first of Gods he gave the meed of minstrelsy, to the
Mother of the Muses, for the Muse came upon the Son of Maia.</p>
<p>Then all the rest of the Immortals, in order of rank and birth, did
he honour, the splendid son of Zeus, telling duly all the tale, as he
struck the lyre on his arm.&nbsp; But on Apollo&rsquo;s heart in his
breast came the stress of desire, who spake to him wing&egrave;d words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou crafty slayer of kine, thou comrade of the feast; thy
song is worth the price of fifty oxen!&nbsp; Henceforth, methinks, shall
we be peacefully made at one.&nbsp; But, come now, tell me this, thou
wily Son of Maia, have these marvels been with thee even since thy birth,
or is it that some immortal, or some mortal man, has given thee the
glorious gift and shown thee song divine?&nbsp; For marvellous is this
new song in mine ears, <!-- page 158--><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>such
as, methinks, none hath known, either of men, or of Immortals who have
mansions in Olympus, save thyself, thou reiver, thou Son of Zeus and
Maia!&nbsp; What art is this, what charm against the stress of cares?&nbsp;
What a path of song! for verily here is choice of all three things,
joy, and love, and sweet sleep.&nbsp; For truly though I be conversant
with the Olympian Muses, to whom dances are a charge, and the bright
minstrel hymn, and rich song, and the lovesome sound of flutes, yet
never yet hath aught else been so dear to my heart, dear as the skill
in the festivals of the Gods.&nbsp; I marvel, Son of Zeus, at this,
the music of thy minstrelsy.&nbsp; But now since, despite thy youth,
thou hast such glorious skill, to thee and to thy Mother I speak this
word of sooth: verily, by this shaft of cornel wood, I shall lead thee
renowned and fortunate among the Immortals, and give thee glorious gifts,
nor in the end deceive thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hermes answered him with cunning words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shrewdly thou questionest me, Far-darter, <!-- page 159--><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>nor
do I grudge thee to enter upon mine art.&nbsp; This day shalt thou know
it: and to thee would I fain be kind in word and will: but within thyself
thou well knowest all things, for first among the Immortals, Son of
Zeus, is thy place.&nbsp; Mighty art thou and strong, and Zeus of wise
counsels loves thee well with reverence due, and hath given thee honour
and goodly gifts.&nbsp; Nay, they tell that thou knowest soothsaying,
Far-darter, by the voice of Zeus: for from Zeus are all oracles, wherein
I myself now know thee to be all-wise.&nbsp; Thy province it is to know
what so thou wilt.&nbsp; Since, then, thy heart bids thee play the lyre,
harp thou and sing, and let joys be thy care, taking this gift from
me; and to me, friend, gain glory.&nbsp; Sweetly sing with my shrill
comrade in thy hands, that knoweth speech good and fair and in order
due.&nbsp; Freely do thou bear it hereafter into the glad feast, and
the winsome dance, and the glorious revel, a joy by night and day.&nbsp;
Whatsoever skilled hand shall inquire of it artfully and wisely, surely
its voice shall teach <!-- page 160--><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>him
all things joyous, being easily played by gentle practice, fleeing dull
toil.&nbsp; But if an unskilled hand first impetuously inquires of it,
vain and discordant shall the false notes sound.&nbsp; But thine it
is of nature to know what things thou wilt: so to thee will I give this
lyre, thou glorious son of Zeus.&nbsp; But we for our part will let
graze thy cattle of the field on the pastures of hill and plain, thou
Far-darter.&nbsp; So shall the kine, consorting with the bulls, bring
forth calves male and female, great store, and no need there is that
thou, wise as thou art, should be vehement in anger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake he, and held forth the lyre that Ph&oelig;bus Apollo took,
and pledged his shining whip in the hands of Hermes, and set him over
the herds.&nbsp; Gladly the son of Maia received it; while the glorious
son of Leto, Apollo, the Prince, the Far-darter, held the lyre in his
left hand, and tuned it orderly with the <i>plectrum</i>.&nbsp; Sweetly
it sounded to his hand, and fair thereto was the song of the God.&nbsp;
Thence anon the twain turned the kine to <!-- page 161--><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>the
rich meadow, but themselves, the glorious children of Zeus, hastened
back to snow-clad Olympus, rejoicing in the lyre: ay, and Zeus, the
counsellor, was glad of it.&nbsp; [Both did he make one in love, and
Hermes loved Leto&rsquo;s son constantly, even as now, since when in
knowledge of his love he pledged to the Far-darter the winsome lyre,
who held it on his arm and played thereon.]&nbsp; But Hermes withal
invented the skill of a new art, the far-heard music of the reed pipes.</p>
<p>Then spake the son of Leto to Hermes thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear me, Son of Maia, thou leader, thou crafty one, lest
thou steal from me both my lyre and my bent bow.&nbsp; For this meed
thou hast from Zeus, to establish the ways of barter among men on the
fruitful earth.&nbsp; Wherefore would that thou shouldst endure to swear
me the great oath of the Gods, with a nod of the head or by the showering
waters of Styx, that thy doings shall ever to my heart be kind and dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with a nod of his head, did Maia&rsquo;s <!-- page 162--><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>son
vow that never would he steal the possessions of the Far-darter, nor
draw nigh his strong dwelling.&nbsp; And Leto&rsquo;s son made vow and
band of love and alliance, that none other among the Gods should be
dearer of Gods or men the seed of Zeus.&nbsp; [And I shall make, with
thee, a perfect token of a Covenant of all Gods and all men, loyal to
my heart and honoured.] <a name="citation162a"></a><a href="#footnote162a">{162a}</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thereafter shall I give thee a fair wand of wealth and fortune,
a golden wand, three-pointed, which shall guard thee harmless, accomplishing
all things good of word and deed that it is mine to learn from the voice
of Zeus. <a name="citation162b"></a><a href="#footnote162b">{162b}</a>&nbsp;
But as touching the art prophetic, oh best of fosterlings of Zeus, concerning
which thou inquirest, for thee it is not fit to learn that <!-- page 163--><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>art,
nay, nor for any other Immortal.&nbsp; That lies in the mind of Zeus
alone.&nbsp; Myself did make pledge, and promise, and strong oath, that,
save me, none other of the eternal Gods should know the secret counsel
of Zeus.&nbsp; And thou, my brother of the Golden Wand, bid me not tell
thee what awful purposes is planning the far-seeing Zeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One mortal shall I harm, and another shall I bless, with many
a turn of fortune among hapless men.&nbsp; Of mine oracle shall he have
profit whosoever comes in the wake of wings and voice of birds of omen:
he shall have profit of mine oracle: him I will not deceive.&nbsp; But
whoso, trusting birds not ominous, approaches mine oracle, to inquire
beyond my will, and know more than the eternal Gods, shall come, I say,
on a bootless journey, yet his gifts shall I receive.&nbsp; Yet another
thing will I tell thee, thou Son of renowned Maia and of Zeus of the
&AElig;gis, thou bringer of boon; there be certain Thri&aelig;, sisters
born, three maidens rejoicing in swift wings.&nbsp; Their heads are
sprinkled with white barley flour, <!-- page 164--><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>and
they dwell beneath a glade of Parnassus, apart they dwell, teachers
of soothsaying.&nbsp; This art I learned while yet a boy I tended the
kine, and my Father heeded not.&nbsp; Thence they flit continually hither
and thither, feeding on honeycombs and bringing all things to fulfilment.&nbsp;
They, when they are full of the spirit of soothsaying, having eaten
of the wan honey, delight to speak forth the truth.&nbsp; But if they
be bereft of the sweet food divine, then lie they all confusedly.&nbsp;
These I bestow on thee, and do thou, inquiring clearly, delight thine
own heart, and if thou instruct any man, he will often hearken to thine
oracle, if he have the good fortune. <a name="citation164"></a><a href="#footnote164">{164}</a>&nbsp;
These be thine, O Son of Maia, and the cattle of the field with twisted
horn do thou tend, and horses, and toilsome mules. . . .&nbsp; And be
lord over the burning eyes of lions, and white-toothed swine, and dogs,
and sheep <!-- page 165--><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>that wide
earth nourishes, and over all flocks be glorious Hermes lord.&nbsp;
And let him alone be herald appointed to Hades, who, though he be giftless,
will give him highest gift of honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With such love, in all kindness, did Apollo pledge the Son of Maia,
and thereto Cronion added grace.&nbsp; With all mortals and immortals
he consorts.&nbsp; Somewhat doth he bless, but ever through the dark
night he beguiles the tribes of mortal men.</p>
<p>Hail to thee thus, Son of Zeus and Maia, of thee shall I be mindful
and of another lay. <!-- page 166--><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span></p>
<h3>III.&nbsp; APHRODITE</h3>
<p>Tell me, Muse, of the deeds of golden Aphrodite, the Cyprian, who
rouses sweet desire among the Immortals, and vanquishes the tribes of
deathly men, and birds that wanton in the air, and all beasts, even
all the clans that earth nurtures, and all in the sea.&nbsp; To all
are dear the deeds of the garlanded Cyprian.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/lang166b.jpg">
<img alt="Aphrodite.  Marble statue in the Louvre" src="images/lang166s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Yet three hearts there be that she cannot persuade or beguile: the
daughter of Zeus of the &AElig;gis, grey-eyed Athene: not to her are
dear the deeds of golden Aphrodite, but war and the work of Ares, battle
and broil, and the mastery of noble arts.&nbsp; First was she to teach
earthly men the fashioning of war chariots and cars fair-wrought with
<!-- page 167--><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>bronze.&nbsp; And
she teaches to tender maidens in the halls all goodly arts, breathing
skill into their minds.&nbsp; Nor ever doth laughter-loving Aphrodite
conquer in desire Artemis of the Golden Distaff, rejoicing in the sound
of the chase, for the bow and arrow are her delight, and slaughter of
the wild beasts on the hills: the lyre, the dance, the clear hunting
halloo, and shadowy glens, and cities of righteous men.</p>
<p>Nor to the revered maiden Hestia are the feats of Aphrodite a joy,
eldest daughter of crooked-counselled Cronos [youngest, too, by the
design of Zeus of the &AElig;gis], that lady whom both Poseidon and
Apollo sought to win.&nbsp; But she would not, nay stubbornly she refused;
and she swore a great oath fulfilled, with her hand on the head of Father
Zeus of the &AElig;gis, to be a maiden for ever, that lady Goddess.&nbsp;
And to her Father Zeus gave a goodly meed of honour, in lieu of wedlock;
and in mid-hall she sat her down choosing the best portion: and in all
temples of the Gods is <!-- page 168--><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>she
honoured, and among all mortals is chief of Gods. <a name="citation168"></a><a href="#footnote168">{168}</a></p>
<p>Of these she cannot win or beguile the hearts.&nbsp; But of all others
there is none, of blessed Gods or mortal men, that hath escaped Aphrodite.&nbsp;
Yea, even the heart of Zeus the Thunderer she led astray; of him that
is greatest of all, and hath the highest lot of honour.&nbsp; Even his
wise wit she hath beguiled at her will, and lightly laid him in the
arms of mortal women; Hera not wotting of it, his sister and his wife,
the fairest in goodliness of beauty among the deathless Goddesses.&nbsp;
To highest honour did they beget her, crooked-counselled Cronos and
Mother Rheia; and Zeus of imperishable counsel made her his chaste and
duteous wife.</p>
<p>But into Aphrodite herself Zeus sent sweet <!-- page 169--><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>desire,
to lie in the arms of a mortal man.&nbsp; This wrought he so that anon
not even she might be unconversant with a mortal bed, and might not
some day with sweet laughter make her boast among all the Gods, the
smiling Aphrodite, that she had given the Gods to mortal paramours,
and they for deathless Gods bare deathly sons, and that she mingled
Goddesses in love with mortal men.&nbsp; Therefore Zeus sent into her
heart sweet desire of Anchises, who as then was pasturing his kine on
the steep hills of many-fountained Ida, a man in semblance like the
Immortals.&nbsp; Him thereafter did smiling Aphrodite see and love,
and measureless desire took hold on her heart.&nbsp; To Cyprus wended
she, within her fragrant shrine: even to Paphos, where is her sacred
garth and odorous altar.&nbsp; Thither went she in, and shut the shining
doors, and there the Graces laved and anointed her with oil ambrosial,
such as is on the bodies of the eternal Gods, sweet fragrant oil that
she had by her.&nbsp; Then clad she her body in goodly raiment, and
<!-- page 170--><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>prinked herself with
gold, the smiling Aphrodite; then sped to Troy, leaving fragrant Cyprus,
and high among the clouds she swiftly accomplished her way.</p>
<p>To many-fountained Ida she came, mother of wild beasts, and made
straight for the steading through the mountain, while behind her came
fawning the beasts, grey wolves, and lions fiery-eyed, and bears, and
swift pards, insatiate pursuers of the roe-deer.&nbsp; Glad was she
at the sight of them, and sent desire into their breasts, and they went
coupling two by two in the shadowy dells.&nbsp; But she came to the
well-builded shielings, <a name="citation170"></a><a href="#footnote170">{170}</a>
and him she found left alone in the shielings with no company, the hero
Anchises, graced with beauty from the Gods.&nbsp; All the rest were
faring after the kine through the grassy pastures, but he, left lonely
at the shielings, walked up and down, harping sweet and shrill.&nbsp;
In front of him stood the daughter of Zeus, Aphrodite, in semblance
and stature like an unwedded maid, lest he should be <!-- page 171--><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>adread
when he beheld the Goddess.&nbsp; And Anchises marvelled when he beheld
her, her height, and beauty, and glistering raiment.&nbsp; For she was
clad in vesture more shining than the flame of fire, and with twisted
armlets and glistering earrings of flower-fashion.&nbsp; About her delicate
neck were lovely jewels, fair and golden: and like the moon&rsquo;s
was the light on her fair breasts, and love came upon Anchises, and
he spake unto her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail, Queen, whosoever of the Immortals thou art that comest
to this house; whether Artemis, or Leto, or golden Aphrodite, or high-born
Themis, or grey-eyed Athene.&nbsp; Or perchance thou art one of the
Graces come hither, who dwell friendly with the Gods, and have a name
to be immortal; or of the nymphs that dwell in this fair glade, or in
this fair mountain, and in the well-heads of rivers, and in grassy dells.&nbsp;
But to thee on some point of outlook, in a place far seen, will I make
an altar, and offer to thee goodly victims in every season.&nbsp; But
for thy part <!-- page 172--><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>be kindly,
and grant me to be a man pre-eminent among the Trojans, and give goodly
seed of children to follow me; but for me, let me live long, and see
the sunlight, and come to the limit of old age, being ever in all things
fortunate among men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Aphrodite the daughter of Zeus answered him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anchises, most renowned of men on earth, behold no Goddess
am I,&mdash;why likenest thou me to the Immortals?&mdash;Nay, mortal
am I, and a mortal mother bare me, and my father is famous Otreus, if
thou perchance hast heard of him, who reigns over strong-warded Phrygia.&nbsp;
Now I well know both your tongue and our own, for a Trojan nurse reared
me in the hall, and nurtured me ever, from the day when she took me
at my mother&rsquo;s hands, and while I was but a little child.&nbsp;
Thus it is, thou seest, that I well know thy tongue as well as my own.&nbsp;
But even now the Argus-slayer of the Golden Wand hath ravished me away
from the choir of Artemis, the Goddess of the Golden <!-- page 173--><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>Distaff,
who loves the noise of the chase.&nbsp; Many nymphs, and maids beloved
of many wooers, were we there at play, and a great circle of people
was about us withal.&nbsp; But thence did he bear me away, the Argus-slayer,
he of the Golden Wand, and bore me over much tilled land of mortal men,
and many wastes unfilled and uninhabited, where wild beasts roam through
the shadowy dells.&nbsp; So fleet we passed that I seemed not to touch
the fertile earth with my feet.&nbsp; Now Hermes said that I was bidden
to be the bride of Anchises, and mother of thy goodly children.&nbsp;
But when he had spoken and shown the thing, lo, instantly he went back
among the immortal Gods,&mdash;the renowned Slayer of Argus.&nbsp; But
I come to thee, strong necessity being laid upon me, and by Zeus I beseech
thee and thy good parents,&mdash;for none ill folk may get such a son
as thee,&mdash;by them I implore thee to take me, a maiden as I am and
untried in love, and show me to thy father and thy discreet mother,
and to thy brothers of one lineage with thee.&nbsp; No <!-- page 174--><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>unseemly
daughter to these, and sister to those will I be, but well worthy; and
do thou send a messenger swiftly to the Phrygians of the dappled steeds,
to tell my father of my fortunes, and my sorrowing mother; gold enough
and woven raiment will they send, and many and goodly gifts shall be
thy meed.&nbsp; Do thou all this, and then busk the winsome wedding-feast,
that is honourable among both men and immortal Gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So speaking, the Goddess brought sweet desire into his heart, and
love came upon Anchises, and he spake, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If indeed thou art mortal and a mortal mother bore thee, and
if renowned Otreus is thy father, and if thou art come hither by the
will of Hermes, the immortal Guide, and art to be called my wife for
ever, then neither mortal man nor immortal God shall hold me from my
desire before I lie with thee in love, now and anon; nay, not even if
Apollo the Far-darter himself were to send the shafts of sorrow from
the silver bow!&nbsp; Nay, thou lady like the Goddesses, willing <!-- page 175--><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>were
I to go down within the house of Hades, if but first I had climbed into
thy bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake he and took her hand; while laughter-loving Aphrodite turned,
and crept with fair downcast eyes towards the bed.&nbsp; It was strewn
for the Prince, as was of wont, with soft garments: and above it lay
skins of bears and deep-voiced lions that he had slain in the lofty
hills.&nbsp; When then they twain had gone up into the well-wrought
bed, first Anchises took from her body her shining jewels, brooches,
and twisted armlets, earrings and chains: and he loosed her girdle,
and unclad her of her glistering raiment, that he laid on a silver-studded
chair.&nbsp; Then through the Gods&rsquo; will and design, by the immortal
Goddess lay the mortal man, not wotting what he did.</p>
<p>Now in the hour when herdsmen drive back the kine and sturdy sheep
to the steading from the flowery pastures, even then the Goddess poured
sweet sleep into Anchises, and clad herself in her goodly raiment. <!-- page 176--><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>
Now when she was wholly clad, the lady Goddess, her head touched the
beam of the lofty roof: and from her cheeks shone forth immortal beauty,&mdash;even
the beauty of fair-garlanded Cytherea.&nbsp; Then she aroused him from
sleep, and spake, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise, son of Dardanus, why now slumberest thou so deeply?&nbsp;
Consider, am I even in aspect such as I was when first thine eyes beheld
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake she, and straightway he started up out of slumber and was
adread, and turned his eyes away when he beheld the neck and the fair
eyes of Aphrodite.&nbsp; His goodly face he veiled again in a cloak,
and imploring her, he spake winged words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so soon as mine eyes first beheld thee, Goddess, I knew
thee for divine: but not sooth didst thou speak to me.&nbsp; But by
Zeus of the &AElig;gis I implore thee, suffer me not to live a strengthless
shadow among men, but pity me: for no man lives in strength that has
couched with immortal Goddesses.&rdquo; <!-- page 177--><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span></p>
<p>Then answered him Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anchises, most renowned of mortal men, take courage, nor fear
overmuch.&nbsp; For no fear is there that thou shalt suffer scathe from
me, nor from others of the blessed Gods, for dear to the Gods art thou.&nbsp;
And to thee shall a dear son be born, and bear sway among the Trojans,
and children&rsquo;s children shall arise after him continually.&nbsp;
Lo, <span class="smcap">&AElig;neas</span> shall his name be called,
since dread sorrow held me when I came into the bed of a mortal man.&nbsp;
And of all mortal men these who spring from thy race are always nearest
to the immortal Gods in beauty and stature; witness how wise-counselling
Zeus carried away golden-haired Ganymedes, for his beauty&rsquo;s sake,
that he might abide with the Immortals and be the cup-bearer of the
Gods in the house of Zeus, a marvellous thing to behold, a mortal honoured
among all the Immortals, as he draws the red nectar from the golden
mixing-bowl.&nbsp; But grief incurable possessed the heart of Tros,
nor knew <!-- page 178--><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>he whither
the wild wind had blown his dear son away, therefore day by day he lamented
him continually till Zeus took pity upon him, and gave him as a ransom
of his son high-stepping horses that bear the immortal Gods.&nbsp; These
he gave him for a gift, and the Guide, the Slayer of Argus, told all
these things by the command of Zeus, even how Ganymedes should be for
ever exempt from old age and death, even as are the Gods.&nbsp; Now
when his father heard this message of Zeus he rejoiced in his heart
and lamented no longer, but was gladly charioted by the wind-fleet horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So too did Dawn of the Golden Throne carry off Tithonus, a
man of your lineage, one like unto the Immortals.&nbsp; Then went she
to pray to Cronion, who hath dark clouds for his tabernacle, that her
lover might be immortal and exempt from death for ever.&nbsp; Thereto
Zeus consented and granted her desire, but foolish of heart was the
Lady Dawn, nor did she deem it good to ask for eternal youth for her
lover, and to keep him unwrinkled by grievous old age. <!-- page 179--><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>
Now so long as winsome youth was his, in joy did he dwell with the Golden-throned
Dawn, the daughter of Morning, at the world&rsquo;s end beside the streams
of Oceanus, but so soon as grey hairs began to flow from his fair head
and goodly chin, the Lady Dawn held aloof from his bed, but kept and
cherished him in her halls, giving him food and ambrosia and beautiful
raiment.&nbsp; But when hateful old age had utterly overcome him, and
he could not move or lift his limbs, to her this seemed the wisest counsel;
she laid him in a chamber, and shut the shining doors, and his voice
flows on endlessly, and no strength now is his such as once there was
in his limbs.&nbsp; Therefore I would not have thee to be immortal and
live for ever in such fashion among the deathless Gods, but if, being
such as thou art in beauty and form, thou couldst live on, and be called
my lord, then this grief would not overshadow my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it may not be, for swiftly will pitiless old age come
upon thee, old age that <!-- page 180--><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>standeth
close by mortal men; wretched and weary, and detested by the Gods: but
among the immortal Gods shall great blame be mine for ever, and all
for love of thee.&nbsp; For the Gods were wont to dread my words and
wiles wherewith I had subdued all the Immortals to mortal women in love,
my purpose overcoming them all; for now, lo you, my mouth will no longer
suffice to speak forth this boast among the Immortals, <a name="citation180"></a><a href="#footnote180">{180}</a>
for deep and sore hath been my folly, wretched and not to be named;
and distraught have I been who carry a child beneath my girdle, the
child of a mortal.&nbsp; Now so soon as he sees the light of the sun
the deep-bosomed mountain nymphs will rear him for me; the nymphs who
haunt this great and holy mountain, being of the clan neither of mortals
nor of immortal Gods.&nbsp; Long is their life, and immortal food do
they eat, and they join in the goodly dance with the immortal Gods.&nbsp;
With them the <!-- page 181--><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>Sileni
and the keen-sighted Slayer of Argus live in dalliance in the recesses
of the darkling caves.&nbsp; At their birth there sprang up pine trees
or tall-crested oaks on the fruitful earth, nourishing and fair, and
on the lofty mountain they stand, and are called the groves of the immortal
Gods, which in no wise doth man cut down with the steel.&nbsp; But when
the fate of death approaches, first do the fair trees wither on the
ground, and the bark about them moulders, and the twigs fall down, and
even as the tree perishes so the soul of the nymph leaves the light
of the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These nymphs will keep my child with them and rear him; and
him when first he enters on lovely youth shall these Goddesses bring
hither to thee, and show thee.&nbsp; But to thee, that I may tell thee
all my mind, will I come in the fifth year bringing my son.&nbsp; At
the sight of him thou wilt be glad when thou beholdest him with thine
eyes, for he will be divinely fair, and thou wilt lead him straightway
to windy Ilios.&nbsp; But if any mortal <!-- page 182--><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>man
asketh of thee what mother bare this thy dear son, be mindful to answer
him as I command: say that he is thy son by one of the flower-faced
nymphs who dwell in this forest-clad mountain, but if in thy folly thou
speakest out, and boastest to have been the lover of fair-garlanded
Cytherea, then Zeus in his wrath will smite thee with the smouldering
thunderbolt.&nbsp; Now all is told to thee: do thou be wise, and keep
thy counsel, and speak not my name, but revere the wrath of the Gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake she, and soared up into the windy heaven.</p>
<p>Goddess, Queen of well-stablished Cyprus, having given thee honour
due, I shall pass on to another hymn. <!-- page 183--><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span></p>
<h3>IV.&nbsp; HYMN TO DEMETER</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/lang183b.jpg">
<img alt="Syracusan medallion by Euainetos.  Obv.  Head of Persephone.  Rev.  Victorious Chariot" src="images/lang183s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Of fair-tressed Demeter, Demeter holy Goddess, I begin to sing: of
her and her slim-ankled daughter whom Hades snatched away, the gift
of wide-beholding Zeus, but Demeter knew it not, she that bears the
Seasons, the giver of goodly crops.&nbsp; For her daughter was playing
with the deep-bosomed maidens of Oceanus, and was gathering flowers&mdash;roses,
and crocuses, and fair <!-- page 184--><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>violets
in the soft meadow, and lilies, and hyacinths, and the narcissus which
the earth brought forth as a snare to the fair-faced maiden, by the
counsel of Zeus and to pleasure the Lord with many guests.&nbsp; Wondrously
bloomed the flower, a marvel for all to see, whether deathless gods
or deathly men.&nbsp; From its root grew forth a hundred blossoms, and
with its fragrant odour the wide heaven above and the whole earth laughed,
and the salt wave of the sea.&nbsp; Then the maiden marvelled, and stretched
forth both her hands to seize the fair plaything, but the wide-wayed
earth gaped in the Nysian plain, and up rushed the Prince, the host
of many guests, the many-named son of Cronos, with his immortal horses.&nbsp;
Maugre her will he seized her, and drave her off weeping in his golden
chariot, but she shrilled aloud, calling on Father Cronides, the highest
of gods and the best.</p>
<p>But no immortal god or deathly man heard the voice of her, . . .
save the daughter of Pers&aelig;us, Hecate of the <!-- page 185--><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>shining
head-tire, as she was thinking delicate thoughts, who heard the cry
from her cave [and Prince Helios, the glorious son of Hyperion], the
maiden calling on Father Cronides.&nbsp; But he far off sat apart from
the gods in his temple haunted by prayers, receiving goodly victims
from mortal men.&nbsp; By the design of Zeus did the brother of Zeus
lead the maiden away, the lord of many, the host of many guests, with
his deathless horses; right sore against her will, even he of many names
the son of Cronos.&nbsp; Now, so long as the Goddess beheld the earth,
and the starry heaven, and the tide of the teeming sea, and the rays
of the sun, and still hoped to behold her mother dear, and the tribes
of the eternal gods; even so long, despite her sorrow, hope warmed her
high heart; then rang the mountain peaks, and the depths of the sea
to her immortal voice, and her lady mother heard her.&nbsp; Then sharp
pain caught at her heart, and with her hands she tore the wimple about
her ambrosial hair, and cast a dark veil about her shoulders, and then
sped she <!-- page 186--><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>like a bird
over land and sea in her great yearning; but to her there was none that
would tell the truth, none, either of Gods, or deathly men, nor even
a bird came nigh her, a soothsaying messenger.&nbsp; Thereafter for
nine days did Lady Deo roam the earth, with torches burning in her hands,
nor ever in her sorrow tasted she of ambrosia and sweet nectar, nor
laved her body in the baths.&nbsp; But when at last the tenth morn came
to her with the light, Hecate met her, a torch in her hands, and spake
a word of tidings, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Demeter, thou that bringest the Seasons, thou giver of
glad gifts, which of the heavenly gods or deathly men hath ravished
away Persephone, and brought thee sorrow: for I heard a voice but I
saw not who the ravisher might be?&nbsp; All this I say to thee for
sooth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake Hecate, and the daughter of fair-tressed Rheie answered
her not, but swiftly rushed on with her, bearing torches burning in
her hands.&nbsp; So came they to <!-- page 187--><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Helios
that watches both for gods and men, and stood before his car, and the
lady Goddess questioned him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helios, be pitiful on me that am a goddess, if ever by word
or deed I gladdened thy heart.&nbsp; My daughter, whom I bore, a sweet
plant and fair to see; it was her shrill voice I heard through the air
unharvested, even as of one violently entreated, but I saw her not with
my eyes.&nbsp; But do thou that lookest down with thy rays from the
holy air upon all the land and sea, do thou tell me truly concerning
my dear child, if thou didst behold her; who it is that hath gone off
and ravished her away from me against her will, who is it of gods or
mortal men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake she, and Hyperionides answered her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter of fair-tressed Rheia, Queen Demeter, thou shalt
know it; for greatly do I pity and revere thee in thy sorrow for thy
slim-ankled child.&nbsp; There is none other guilty of the Immortals
but Zeus himself that gathereth the clouds, who gave thy daughter <!-- page 188--><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>to
Hades, his own brother, to be called his lovely wife; and Hades has
ravished her away in his chariot, loudly shrilling, beneath the dusky
gloom.&nbsp; But, Goddess, do thou cease from thy long lamenting.&nbsp;
It behoves not thee thus vainly to cherish anger unassuaged.&nbsp; No
unseemly lord for thy daughter among the Immortals is Aidoneus, the
lord of many, thine own brother and of one seed with thee, and for his
honour he won, since when was made the threefold division, to be lord
among those with whom he dwells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake he, and called upon his horses, and at his call they swiftly
bore the fleet chariot on like long-winged birds.&nbsp; But grief more
dread and bitter fell upon her, and wroth thereafter was she with Cronion
that hath dark clouds for his dwelling.&nbsp; She held apart from the
gathering of the Gods and from tall Olympus, and disfiguring her form
for many days she went among the cities and rich fields of men.&nbsp;
Now no man knew her that looked on her, nor no deep-bosomed woman, till
she came to the dwelling of <!-- page 189--><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>Celeus,
who then was Prince of fragrant Eleusis.&nbsp; There sat she at the
wayside in sorrow of heart, by the Maiden Well whence the townsfolk
were wont to draw water.&nbsp; In the shade she sat; above her grew
a thick olive-tree; and in fashion she was like an ancient crone who
knows no more of child-bearing and the gifts of Aphrodite, the lover
of garlands.&nbsp; Such she was as are the nurses of the children of
doom-pronouncing kings.&nbsp; Such are the housekeepers in their echoing
halls.</p>
<p>Now the daughters of Celeus beheld her as they came to fetch the
fair-flowing water, to carry thereof in bronze vessels to their father&rsquo;s
home.&nbsp; Four were they, like unto goddesses, all in the bloom of
youth, Callidice, and Cleisidice, and winsome Demo, and Callithoe the
eldest of them all, nor did they know her, for the Gods are hard to
be known by mortals, but they stood near her and spake winged words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou and whence, old woman, of ancient folk, and why
wert thou wandering <!-- page 190--><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>apart
from the town, nor dost draw nigh to the houses where are women of thine
own age, in the shadowy halls, even such as thou, and younger women,
too, who may kindly entreat thee in word and deed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake they, and the lady Goddess answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear children, whoever ye be, of womankind I bid you hail,
and I will tell you my story.&nbsp; Seemly it is to answer your questions
truly.&nbsp; Deo is my name that my lady mother gave me; but now, look
you, from Crete am I come hither over the wide ridges of the sea, by
no will of my own, nay, by violence have sea-rovers brought me hither
under duress, who thereafter touched with their swift ship at Thoricos
where the women and they themselves embarked on land.&nbsp; Then were
they busy about supper beside the hawsers of the ship, but my heart
heeded not delight of supper; no, stealthily setting forth through the
dark land I fled from these overweening masters, that they might not
sell me whom they had never bought <!-- page 191--><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>and
gain my price.&nbsp; Thus hither have I come in my wandering, nor know
I at all what land is this, nor who they be that dwell therein.&nbsp;
But to you may all they that hold mansions in Olympus give husbands
and lords, and such children to bear as parents desire; but me do ye
maidens pity in your kindness, till I come to the house of woman or
of man, that there I may work zealously for them in such tasks as fit
a woman of my years.&nbsp; I could carry in mine arms a new-born babe,
and nurse it well, and keep the house, and strew my master&rsquo;s bed
within the well-builded chambers, and teach the maids their tasks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake the Goddess, and straightway answered her the maid unwed,
Callidice, the fairest of the daughters of Celeus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, what things soever the Gods do give must men, though
sorrowing, endure, for the Gods are far stronger than we; but this will
I tell thee clearly and soothly, namely, what men they are who here
have most honour, and who lead the people, and by <!-- page 192--><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>their
counsels and just dooms do safeguard the bulwarks of the city.&nbsp;
Such are wise Triptolemus, Diocles, Polyxenus, and noble Eumolpus, and
Dolichus, and our lordly father.&nbsp; All their wives keep their houses,
and not one of them would at first sight contemn thee and thrust thee
from their halls, but gladly they will receive thee: for thine aspect
is divine.&nbsp; So, if thou wilt, abide here, that we may go to the
house of my father, and tell out all this tale to my mother, the deep-bosomed
Metaneira, if perchance she will bid thee come to our house and not
seek the homes of others.&nbsp; A dear son born in her later years is
nurtured in the well-builded hall, a child of many prayers and a welcome.&nbsp;
If thou wouldst nurse him till he comes to the measure of youth, then
whatsoever woman saw thee should envy thee; such gifts of fosterage
would my mother give thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake she and the Goddess nodded assent.&nbsp; So rejoicing they
filled their shining pitchers with water and bore them away.&nbsp; Swiftly
they came to the high hall of their <!-- page 193--><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>father,
and quickly they told their mother what they had heard and seen, and
speedily she bade them run and call the strange woman, offering goodly
hire.&nbsp; Then as deer or calves in the season of Spring leap along
the meadow, when they have had their fill of pasture, so lightly they
kilted up the folds of their lovely kirtles, and ran along the hollow
chariot-way, while their hair danced on their shoulders, in colour like
the crocus flower.&nbsp; They found the glorious Goddess at the wayside,
even where they had left her, and anon they led her to their father&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; But she paced behind in heaviness of heart, her head veiled,
and the dark robe floating about her slender feet divine.&nbsp; Speedily
they came to the house of Celeus, the fosterling of Zeus, and they went
through the corridor where their lady mother was sitting by the doorpost
of the well-wrought hall, with her child in her lap, a young blossom,
and the girls ran up to her, but the Goddess stood on the threshold,
her head touching the <!-- page 194--><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>roof-beam,
and she filled the doorway with the light divine.&nbsp; Then wonder,
and awe, and pale fear seized the mother, and she gave place from her
high seat, and bade the Goddess be seated.&nbsp; But Demeter the bearer
of the Seasons, the Giver of goodly gifts, would not sit down upon the
shining high seat.&nbsp; Nay, in silence she waited, casting down her
lovely eyes, till the wise Iambe set for her a well-made stool, and
cast over it a glistering fleece. <a name="citation194"></a><a href="#footnote194">{194}</a>&nbsp;
Then sat she down and held the veil before her face; long in sorrow
and silence sat she so, and spake to no man nor made any sign, but smileless
she sat, nor tasted meat nor drink, wasting with long desire for her
deep-bosomed daughter.</p>
<p>So abode she till wise Iambe with jests and many mockeries beguiled
the lady, the holy one, to smile and laugh and hold a happier heart,
and pleased her moods even thereafter.&nbsp; Then Metaneira filled a
cup of sweet wine and offered it to her, but she refused it, saying,
that it was not permitted for her to <!-- page 195--><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>drink
red wine; but she bade them mix meal and water with the tender herb
of mint, and give it to her to drink.&nbsp; Then Metaneira made a potion
and gave it to the Goddess as she bade, and Lady Deo took it and made
libation, and to them fair-girdled Metaneira said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail, lady, for methinks thou art not of mean parentage, but
goodly born, for grace and honour shine in thine eyes as in the eyes
of doom-dealing kings.&nbsp; But the gifts of the Gods, even in sorrow,
we men of necessity endure, for the yoke is laid upon our necks; yet
now that thou art come hither, such things as I have shall be thine.&nbsp;
Rear me this child that the Gods have given in my later years and beyond
my hope; and he is to me a child of many prayers.&nbsp; If thou rear
him, and he come to the measure of youth, verily each woman that sees
thee will envy thee, such shall be my gifts of fosterage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered her again Demeter of the fair garland:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mayst thou too, lady, fare well, and <!-- page 196--><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>the
Gods give thee all things good.&nbsp; Gladly will I receive thy child
that thou biddest me nurse.&nbsp; Never, methinks, by the folly of his
nurse shall charm or sorcery harm him; for I know an antidote stronger
than the wild wood herb, and a goodly salve I know for the venomed spells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake she, and with her immortal hands she placed the child on
her fragrant breast, and the mother was glad at heart.&nbsp; So in the
halls she nursed the goodly son of wise Celeus, even Demophoon, whom
deep-breasted Metaneira bare, and he grew like a god, upon no mortal
food, nor on no mother&rsquo;s milk.&nbsp; For Demeter anointed him
with ambrosia as though he had been a son of a God, breathing sweetness
over him, and keeping him in her bosom.&nbsp; So wrought she by day,
but at night she was wont to hide him in the force of fire like a brand,
his dear parents knowing it not. <a name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196">{196}</a>&nbsp;
Nay, to <!-- page 197--><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>them it was
great marvel how flourished he and grew like the Gods to look upon.&nbsp;
And, verily, she would have made him exempt from eld and death for ever,
had not fair-girdled Metaneira, in her witlessness, spied on her in
the night from her fragrant chamber.&nbsp; Then wailed she, and smote
both her thighs, in terror for her child, and in anguish of heart, and
lamenting she spake wing&egrave;d words: &ldquo;My child Demophoon,
the stranger is concealing thee in the heart of the fire; bitter sorrow
for me and lamentation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake she, wailing, and the lady Goddess heard her.&nbsp; Then
in wrath did the fair-garlanded Demeter snatch out of the fire with
her immortal hands and cast upon the ground that woman&rsquo;s dear
son, whom beyond all hope she had borne in the halls.&nbsp; Dread was
the wrath of Demeter, and anon she spake to fair-girdled Metaneira.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh redeless and uncounselled race of men, that know not beforehand
the fate of coming good or coming evil.&nbsp; For, lo, thou hast wrought
upon thyself a bane incurable, by <!-- page 198--><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>thine
own witlessness; for by the oath of the Gods, the relentless water of
Styx, I would have made thy dear child deathless and exempt from age
for ever, and would have given him glory imperishable.&nbsp; But now
in nowise may he escape the Fates and death, yet glory imperishable
will ever be his, since he has lain on my knees and slept within my
arms; [but as the years go round, and in his day, the sons of the Eleusinians
will ever wage war and dreadful strife one upon the other.]&nbsp; Now
I am the honoured Demeter, the greatest good and gain of the Immortals
to deathly men.&nbsp; But, come now, let all the people build me a great
temple and an altar thereby, below the town, and the steep wall, above
Callichorus on the jutting rock.&nbsp; But the rites I myself will prescribe,
that in time to come ye may pay them duly and appease my power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therewith the Goddess changed her shape and height, and cast off
old age, and beauty breathed about her, and the sweet scent was breathed
from her fragrant robes, and afar <!-- page 199--><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>shone
the light from the deathless body of the Goddess, the yellow hair flowing
about her shoulders, so that the goodly house was filled with the splendour
as of levin fire, and forth from the halls went she.</p>
<p>But anon the knees of the woman were loosened, and for long time
she was speechless, nay, nor did she even mind of the child, her best
beloved, to lift him from the floor.&nbsp; But the sisters of the child
heard his pitiful cry, and leapt from their fair-strewn beds; one of
them, lifting the child in her hands, laid it in her bosom; and another
lit fire, and the third ran with smooth feet to take her mother forth
from the fragrant chamber.&nbsp; Then gathered they about the child,
and bathed and clad him lovingly, yet his mood was not softened, for
meaner nurses now and handmaids held him.</p>
<p>They the long night through were adoring the renowned Goddess, trembling
with fear, but at the dawning they told truly to mighty Celeus all that
the Goddess had commanded; <!-- page 200--><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>even
Demeter of the goodly garland.&nbsp; Thereon he called into the market-place
the many people, and bade them make a rich temple, and an altar to fair-tressed
Demeter, upon the jutting rock.&nbsp; Then anon they heard and obeyed
his voice, and as he bade they builded.&nbsp; And the child increased
in strength by the Goddess&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>Now when they had done their work, and rested from their labours,
each man started for his home, but yellow-haired Demeter, sitting there
apart from all the blessed Gods, abode, wasting away with desire for
her deep-bosomed daughter.&nbsp; Then the most dread and terrible of
years did the Goddess bring for mortals upon the fruitful earth, nor
did the earth send up the seed, for Demeter of the goodly garland concealed
it.&nbsp; Many crooked ploughs did the oxen drag through the furrows
in vain, and much white barley fell fruitless upon the land.&nbsp; Now
would the whole race of mortal men have perished utterly from the stress
of famine, and the Gods that hold mansions in Olympus would <!-- page 201--><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>have
lost the share and renown of gift and sacrifice, if Zeus had not conceived
a counsel within his heart.</p>
<p>First he roused Iris of the golden wings to speed forth and call
the fair-tressed Demeter, the lovesome in beauty.&nbsp; So spake Zeus,
and Iris obeyed Zeus, the son of Cronos, who hath dark clouds for his
tabernacle, and swiftly she sped adown the space between heaven and
earth.&nbsp; Then came she to the citadel of fragrant Eleusis, and in
the temple she found Demeter clothed in dark raiment, and speaking wing&egrave;d
words addressed her: &ldquo;Demeter, Father Zeus, whose counsels are
imperishable, bids thee back unto the tribes of the eternal Gods.&nbsp;
Come thou, then, lest the word of Zeus be of no avail.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So spake she in her prayer, but the Goddess yielded not.&nbsp; Thereafter
the Father sent forth all the blessed Gods, all of the Immortals, and
coming one by one they bade Demeter return, and gave her many splendid
gifts, and all honours that she might choose among the immortal Gods.
<!-- page 202--><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span> But none availed
to persuade by turning her mind and her angry heart, so stubbornly she
refused their sayings.&nbsp; For she deemed no more for ever to enter
fragrant Olympus, and no more to allow the earth to bear her fruit,
until her eyes should behold her fair-faced daughter.</p>
<p>But when far-seeing Zeus, the lord of the thunder-peal, had heard
the thing, he sent to Erebus the slayer of Argos, the God of the golden
wand, to win over Hades with soft words, and persuade him to bring up
holy Persephone into the light, and among the Gods, from forth the murky
gloom, that so her mother might behold her, and that her anger might
relent.&nbsp; And Hermes disobeyed not, but straightway and speedily
went forth beneath the hollow places of the earth, leaving the home
of Olympus.&nbsp; That King he found within his dwelling, sitting on
a couch with his chaste bedfellow, who sorely grieved for desire of
her mother, that still was cherishing a fell design against the ill
deeds of the Gods.&nbsp; Then the strong slayer <!-- page 203--><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>of
Argos drew near and spoke: &ldquo;Hades of the dark locks, thou Prince
of men out-worn, Father Zeus bade me bring the dread Persephone forth
from Erebus among the Gods, that her mother may behold her, and relent
from her anger and terrible wrath against the Immortals, for now she
contrives a mighty deed, to destroy the feeble tribes of earth-born
men by withholding the seed under the earth.&nbsp; Thereby the honours
of the Gods are minished, and fierce is her wrath, nor mingles she with
the Gods, but sits apart within the fragrant temple in the steep citadel
of Eleusis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake he, and smiling were the brows of Aidoneus, Prince of the
dead, nor did he disobey the commands of King Zeus, as speedily he bade
the wise Persephone: &ldquo;Go, Persephone, to thy dark-mantled mother,
go with a gentle spirit in thy breast, nor be thou beyond all other
folk disconsolate.&nbsp; Verily I shall be no unseemly lord of thine
among the Immortals, I that am the brother of Father Zeus, and whilst
<!-- page 204--><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>thou art here shalt
thou be mistress over all that lives and moves, but among the Immortals
shalt thou have the greatest renown.&nbsp; Upon them that wrong thee
shall vengeance be unceasing, upon them that solicit not thy power with
sacrifice, and pious deeds, and every acceptable gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake he, and wise Persephone was glad; and joyously and swiftly
she arose, but the God himself, stealthily looking around her, gave
her sweet pomegranate seed to eat, and this he did that she might not
abide for ever beside revered Demeter of the dark mantle. <a name="citation204"></a><a href="#footnote204">{204}</a>&nbsp;
Then openly did Aidoneus, the Prince of all, get ready the steeds beneath
the golden chariot, and she climbed up into the golden chariot, and
beside her the strong Slayer of Argos took reins and whip in hand, and
drove forth from the halls, and gladly sped the horses twain.&nbsp;
Speedily they devoured the long way; nor sea, nor rivers, nor grassy
glades, nor cliffs, could stay the rush of the deathless horses; nay,
far above <!-- page 205--><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>them they
cleft the deep air in their course.&nbsp; Before the fragrant temple
he drove them, and checked them where dwelt Demeter of the goodly garland,
who, when she beheld them, rushed forth like a M&aelig;nad down a dark
mountain woodland. <a name="citation205"></a><a href="#footnote205">{205}</a></p>
<p>[But Persephone on the other side rejoiced to see her mother dear,
and leaped to meet her; but the mother said, &ldquo;Child, in Hades
hast thou eaten any food? for if thou hast not] then with me and thy
father the son of Cronos, who has dark clouds for his tabernacle, shalt
thou ever dwell honoured among all the Immortals.&nbsp; But if thou
hast tasted food, thou must return again, and beneath the hollows of
the earth must dwell in Hades a third portion of the year; yet two parts
of the year thou shalt abide with me and the other Immortals.&nbsp;
When the earth blossoms with all manner of fragrant flowers, then from
beneath the murky gloom shalt thou come again, a mighty marvel to <!-- page 206--><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>Gods
and to mortal men.&nbsp; Now tell me by what wile the strong host of
many guests deceived thee? . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>Then fair Persephone answered her august mother: &ldquo;Behold, I
shall tell thee all the truth without fail.&nbsp; I leaped up for joy
when boon Hermes, the swift messenger, came from my father Cronides
and the other heavenly Gods, with the message that I was to return out
of Erebus, that so thou mightest behold me, and cease thine anger and
dread wrath against the Immortals.&nbsp; Thereon Hades himself compelled
me to taste of a sweet pomegranate seed against my will.&nbsp; And now
I will tell thee how, through the crafty device of Cronides my father,
he ravished me, and bore me away beneath the hollows of the earth.&nbsp;
All that thou askest I will tell thee.&nbsp; We were all playing in
the lovely meadows, Leucippe and Phaino, and Electra, and Ianthe, and
Melit&ecirc;, and Iach&ecirc;, and Rhodeia, and Callirhoe, and Melobosis,
and Tuch&ecirc;, and flower-faced Ocyroe, and Chr&aelig;sis, and Ianeira,
and Acast&ecirc;, and Admet&ecirc;, and Rhodope, <!-- page 207--><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>and
Plouto, and winsome Calypso, and Styx, and Urania, and beautiful Galaxaur&ecirc;.&nbsp;
We were playing there, and plucking beautiful blossoms with our hands;
crocuses mingled, and iris, and hyacinth, and roses, and lilies, a marvel
to behold, and narcissus, that the wide earth bare, a wile for my undoing.&nbsp;
Gladly was I gathering them when the earth gaped beneath, and therefrom
leaped the mighty Prince, the host of many guests, and he bare me against
my will despite my grief beneath the earth, in his golden chariot; and
shrilly did I cry.&nbsp; This all is true that I tell thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the livelong day in oneness of heart did they cheer each other
with love, and their minds ceased from sorrow, and great gladness did
either win from other.&nbsp; Then came to them Hekat&ecirc; of the fair
wimple, and often did she kiss the holy daughter of Demeter, and from
that day was her queenly comrade and handmaiden; but to them for a messenger
did far-seeing Zeus of the loud thunder-peal send fair-tressed Rhea
to bring <!-- page 208--><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>dark-mantled
Demeter among the Gods, with pledge of what honour she might choose
among the Immortals.&nbsp; He vowed that her daughter, for the third
part of the revolving year, should dwell beneath the murky gloom, but
for the other two parts she should abide with her mother and the other
gods.</p>
<p>Thus he spake, and the Goddess disobeyed not the commands of Zeus.&nbsp;
Swiftly she sped down from the peaks of Olympus, and came to fertile
Rarion; fertile of old, but now no longer fruitful; for fallow and leafless
it lay, and hidden was the white barley grain by the device of fair-ankled
Demeter.&nbsp; None the less with the growing of the Spring the land
was to teem with tall ears of corn, and the rich furrows were to be
heavy with corn, and the corn to be bound in sheaves.&nbsp; There first
did she land from the unharvested ether, and gladly the Goddesses looked
on each other, and rejoiced in heart, and thus first did Rhea of the
fair wimple speak to Demeter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hither, child; for he calleth thee, far-seeing <!-- page 209--><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>Zeus,
the lord of the deep thunder, to come among the Gods, and has promised
thee such honours as thou wilt, and hath decreed that thy child, for
the third of the rolling year, shall dwell beneath the murky gloom,
but the other two parts with her mother and the rest of the Immortals.&nbsp;
So doth he promise that it shall be and thereto nods his head; but come,
my child, obey, and be not too unrelenting against the Son of Cronos,
the lord of the dark cloud.&nbsp; And anon do thou increase the grain
that bringeth life to men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake she, and Demeter of the fair garland obeyed.&nbsp; Speedily
she sent up the grain from the rich glebe, and the wide earth was heavy
with leaves and flowers: and she hastened, and showed the thing to the
kings, the dealers of doom; to Triptolemus and Diocles the charioteer,
and mighty Eumolpus, and Celeus the leader of the people; she showed
them the manner of her rites, and taught them her goodly mysteries,
holy mysteries which none may <!-- page 210--><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>violate,
or search into, or noise abroad, for the great curse from the Gods restrains
the voice.&nbsp; Happy is he among deathly men who hath beheld these
things! and he that is uninitiate, and hath no lot in them, hath never
equal lot in death beneath the murky gloom.</p>
<p>Now when the Goddess had given instruction in all her rites, they
went to Olympus, to the gathering of the other Gods.&nbsp; There the
Goddesses dwell beside Zeus the lord of the thunder, holy and revered
are they.&nbsp; Right happy is he among mortal men whom they dearly
love; speedily do they send as a guest to his lofty hall Plutus, who
giveth wealth to mortal men.&nbsp; But come thou that holdest the land
of fragrant Eleusis, and sea-girt Paros, and rocky Antron, come, Lady
Deo!&nbsp; Queen and giver of goodly gifts, and bringer of the Seasons;
come thou and thy daughter, beautiful Persephone, and of your grace
grant me goodly substance in requital of my song; but I will mind me
of thee, and of other minstrelsy. <!-- page 211--><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span></p>
<h3>V.&nbsp; TO APHRODIT&Eacute;</h3>
<p>I shall sing of the revered Aphrodit&eacute;, the golden-crowned,
the beautiful, who hath for her portion the mountain crests of sea-girt
Cyprus.&nbsp; Thither the strength of the west wind moistly blowing
carried her amid soft foam over the wave of the resounding sea.&nbsp;
Her did the golden-snooded Hours gladly welcome, and clad her about
in immortal raiment, and on her deathless head set a well-wrought crown,
fair and golden, and in her ears put earrings of orichalcum and of precious
gold.&nbsp; Her delicate neck and white bosom they adorned with chains
of gold, wherewith are bedecked the golden-snooded Hours themselves,
when they come to the glad dance of the Gods in the dwelling of the
Father.&nbsp; Anon when they had thus <!-- page 212--><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>adorned
her in all goodliness they led her to the Immortals, who gave her greeting
when they beheld her, and welcomed her with their hands; and each God
prayed that he might lead her home to be his wedded wife, so much they
marvelled at the beauty of the fair-garlanded Cytherean.&nbsp; Hail,
thou of the glancing eyes, thou sweet winsome Goddess, and grant that
I bear off the victory in this contest, and lend thou grace to my song,
while I shall both remember thee and another singing. <!-- page 213--><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span></p>
<h3>VI.&nbsp; TO DIONYSUS</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/lang213b.jpg">
<img alt="Dionysus sailing in his sacred ship.  (Interior Design on a Kylix by Exekias in Munich.)" src="images/lang213s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Concerning Dionysus the son of renowned Semele shall I sing; how
once he appeared upon the shore of the sea unharvested, on a jutting
headland, in form <!-- page 214--><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>like
a man in the bloom of youth, with his beautiful dark hair waving around
him, and on his strong shoulders a purple robe.&nbsp; Anon came in sight
certain men that were pirates; in a well-wrought ship sailing swiftly
on the dark seas: Tyrsenians were they, and Ill Fate was their leader,
for they beholding him nodded each to other, and swiftly leaped forth,
and hastily seized him, and set him aboard their ship rejoicing in heart,
for they deemed that he was the son of kings, the fosterlings of Zeus,
and they were minded to bind him with grievous bonds.&nbsp; But him
the fetters held not, and the withes fell far from his hands and feet.
<a name="citation214"></a><a href="#footnote214">{214}</a>&nbsp; There
sat he smiling with his dark eyes, but the steersman saw it, and spake
aloud to his companions: &ldquo;Fools, what God have ye taken and bound?
a strong God is he, our trim ship may not contain him.&nbsp; Surely
this is Zeus, or Apollo <!-- page 215--><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>of
the Silver Bow, or Poseidon; for he is nowise like mortal man, but like
the Gods who have mansions in Olympus.&nbsp; Nay, come let us instantly
release him upon the dark mainland, nor lay ye your hands upon him,
lest, being wroth, he rouse against us masterful winds and rushing storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake he, but their captain rebuked him with a hateful word: &ldquo;Fool,
look thou to the wind, and haul up the sail, and grip to all the gear,
but this fellow will be for men to meddle with.&nbsp; Methinks he will
come to Egypt, or to Cyprus, or to the Hyperboreans, or further far;
and at the last he will tell us who his friends are, and concerning
his wealth, and his brethren, for the God has delivered him into our
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So spake he, and let raise the mast and hoist the mainsail, and the
wind filled the sail, and they made taut the ropes all round.&nbsp;
But anon strange matters appeared to them: first there flowed through
all the swift black ship a sweet and fragrant wine, and the <!-- page 216--><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>ambrosial
fragrance arose, and fear fell upon all the mariners that beheld it.&nbsp;
And straightway a vine stretched hither and thither along the sail,
hanging with many a cluster, and dark ivy twined round the mast blossoming
with flowers, and gracious fruit and garlands grew on all the thole-pins;
and they that saw it bade the steersman drive straight to land.&nbsp;
Meanwhile within the ship the God changed into the shape of a lion at
the bow; and loudly he roared, and in midship he made a shaggy bear:
such marvels he showed forth: there stood it raging, and on the deck
glared the lion terribly.&nbsp; Then the men fled in terror to the stern,
and there stood in fear round the honest pilot.&nbsp; But suddenly sprang
forth the lion and seized the captain, and the men all at once leaped
overboard into the strong sea, shunning dread doom, and there were changed
into dolphins.&nbsp; But the God took pity upon the steersman, and kept
him, and gave him all good fortune, and spake, saying, &ldquo;Be of
good courage, <!-- page 217--><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>Sir,
dear art thou to me, and I am Dionysus of the noisy rites whom Cadmeian
Semele bare to the love of Zeus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hail, thou child of beautiful
Semele, none that is mindless of thee can fashion sweet minstrelsy.
<!-- page 218--><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span></p>
<h3>VII.&nbsp; TO ARES</h3>
<p>Ares, thou that excellest in might, thou lord of the chariot of war,
God of the golden helm, thou mighty of heart, thou shield-bearer, thou
safety of cities, thou that smitest in mail; strong of hand and unwearied
valiant spearman, bulwark of Olympus, father of victory, champion of
Themis; thou tyrannous to them that oppose thee with force; thou leader
of just men, thou master of manlihood, thou that whirlest thy flaming
sphere among the courses of the seven stars of the sky, where thy fiery
steeds ever bear thee above the third orbit of heaven; do thou listen
to me, helper of mortals, Giver of the bright bloom of youth.&nbsp;
Shed thou down a mild light from above upon this life of mine, and my
<!-- page 219--><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>martial strength,
so that I may be of avail to drive away bitter cowardice from my head,
and to curb the deceitful rush of my soul, and to restrain the sharp
stress of anger which spurs me on to take part in the dread din of battle.&nbsp;
But give me heart, O blessed one, to abide in the painless measures
of peace, avoiding the battle-cry of foes and the compelling fates of
death. <!-- page 220--><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span></p>
<h3>VIII.&nbsp; TO ARTEMIS</h3>
<p>Sing thou of Artemis, Muse, the sister of the Far-darter; the archer
Maid, fellow-nursling with Apollo, who waters her steeds in the reedy
wells of Meles, then swiftly drives her golden chariot through Smyrna
to Claros of the many-clustered vines, where sits Apollo of the Silver
Bow awaiting the far-darting archer maid.&nbsp; And hail thou thus,
and hail to all Goddesses in my song, but to thee first, and beginning
from thee, will I sing, and so shall pass on to another lay. <!-- page 221--><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span></p>
<h3>IX.&nbsp; TO APHRODITE</h3>
<p>I shall sing of Cytherea, the Cyprus-born, who gives sweet gifts
to mortals, and ever on her face is a winsome smile, and ever in her
hand a winsome blossom.&nbsp; Hail to thee, Goddess, Queen of fair-set
Salamis, and of all Cyprus, and give to me song desirable, while I shall
be mindful of thee and of another song. <!-- page 222--><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span></p>
<h3>X.&nbsp; TO ATHENE</h3>
<p>Of Pallas Athene, the saviour of cities, I begin to sing; dread Goddess,
who with Ares takes keep of the works of war, and of falling cities,
and battles, and the battle din.&nbsp; She it is that saveth the hosts
as they go and return from the fight.&nbsp; Hail Goddess, and give to
us happiness and good fortune. <!-- page 223--><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span></p>
<h3>XI.&nbsp; TO HERA</h3>
<p>I sing of golden-throned Hera, whom Rhea bore, an immortal queen
in beauty pre-eminent, the sister and the bride of loud-thundering Zeus,
the lady renowned, whom all the Blessed throughout high Olympus honour
and revere no less than Zeus whose delight is the thunder. <!-- page 224--><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span></p>
<h3>XII.&nbsp; TO DEMETER</h3>
<p>Of fair-tressed Demeter the holy Goddess I begin to sing; of her
and the Maiden, the lovely Persephone.&nbsp; Hail Goddess, and save
this city and inspire my song. <!-- page 225--><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span></p>
<h3>XIII.&nbsp; TO THE MOTHER OF THE GODS</h3>
<p>Sing for me, clear-voiced Muse, daughter of great Zeus, the mother
of all Gods and all mortals, who is glad in the sound of rattles and
drums, and in the noise of flutes, and in the cry of wolves and fiery-eyed
lions, and in the echoing hills, and the woodland haunts; even so hail
to thee and to Goddesses all in my song. <!-- page 226--><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span></p>
<h3>XIV.&nbsp; TO HERACLES THE LION-HEART</h3>
<p>Of Heracles the son of Zeus will I sing, mightiest of mortals, whom
Alcmena bore in Thebes of the fair dancing places, for she had lain
in the arms of Cronion, the lord of the dark clouds.&nbsp; Of old the
hero wandered endlessly over land and sea, at the bidding of Eurystheus
the prince, and himself wrought many deeds of fateful might, and many
he endured; but now in the fair haunts of snowy Olympus he dwells in
joy, and hath white-ankled Hebe for his wife.&nbsp; Hail prince, son
of Zeus, and give to us valour and good fortune. <!-- page 227--><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span></p>
<h3>XV.&nbsp; TO ASCLEPIUS</h3>
<p>Of the healer of diseases, Asclepius, I begin to sing, the son of
Apollo, whom fair Coronis bore in the Dotian plain, the daughter of
King Phlegyas; a great joy to men was her son, and the soother of evil
pains.&nbsp; Even so do thou hail, O Prince, I pray to thee in my song.
<!-- page 228--><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span></p>
<h3>XVI.&nbsp; TO THE DIOSCOURI</h3>
<p>Of Castor and Polydeuces do thou sing,&mdash;shrill Muse, the Tyndarid&aelig;,
sons of Olympian Zeus, whom Lady Leda bore beneath the crests of Taygetus,
having been secretly conquered by the desire of Cronion of the dark
clouds.&nbsp; Hail, ye sons of Tyndarus, ye cavaliers of swift steeds.
<!-- page 229--><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span></p>
<h3>XVII.&nbsp; TO HERMES</h3>
<p>I sing of Cyllenian Hermes, slayer of Argus, prince of Cyllene and
of Arcadia rich in sheep, the boon messenger of the Immortals.&nbsp;
Him did Maia bear, the modest daughter of Atlas, to the love of Zeus.&nbsp;
The company of the blessed Gods she shunned, and dwelt in a shadowy
cave where Cronion was wont to lie with the fair-tressed nymph in the
dark of night, while sweet sleep possessed white-armed Hera, and no
Immortals knew it, and no deathly men.&nbsp; Hail to thee, thou son
of Zeus and Maia, with thee shall I begin and pass on to another song.&nbsp;
Hail, Hermes, Giver of grace, thou Guide, thou Giver of good things.
<!-- page 230--><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span></p>
<h3>XVIII.&nbsp; TO PAN</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/lang230b.jpg">
<img alt="Pan.  With Goat and Shepherd&rsquo;s Crook.  Terra cotta Statuette from Tanagra, in the British Museum" src="images/lang230s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Tell me, Muse, concerning the dear son of Hermes, the goat-footed,
the twy-horned, the lover of the din of revel, who haunts the wooded
dells with dancing nymphs that tread the crests of the steep cliffs,
calling upon Pan the pastoral God of the long wild hair.&nbsp; Lord
is he of every snowy crest and mountain peak and rocky path.&nbsp; Hither
and thither he goes through the thick copses, sometimes being drawn
to the still waters, and sometimes faring through the lofty crags he
climbs the highest peak whence the flocks are seen below; ever he ranges
over the high white hills, and ever among the knolls he chases and slays
the wild beasts, the God, with keen eye, and at evening returns piping
from the chase, <!-- page 231--><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>breathing
sweet strains on the reeds.&nbsp; In song that bird cannot excel him
which, among the leaves of the blossoming springtide, pours forth her
plaint and her honey-sweet song.&nbsp; With him then the mountain nymphs,
the shrill singers, go wandering with light feet, and sing at the side
of the dark water of the well, while the echo moans along the mountain
crest, and the God leaps hither and thither, and goes into the midst,
with many a step of the dance.&nbsp; On his back he wears the tawny
hide of a lynx, and his heart rejoices with shrill songs in the soft
meadow where crocus and fragrant hyacinth bloom all mingled amidst the
grass.&nbsp; They sing of the blessed Gods and of high Olympus, and
above all do they sing of boon Hermes, how he is the fleet herald of
all the Gods, and how he came to many-fountained Arcadia, the mother
of sheep, where is his Cyllenian demesne, and there he, God as he was,
shepherded the fleecy sheep, the thrall of a mortal man; for soft desire
had come upon <!-- page 232--><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>him
to wed the fair-haired daughter of Dryops, and the glad nuptials he
accomplished, and to Hermes in the hall she bare a dear son.&nbsp; From
his birth he was a marvel to behold, goat-footed, twy-horned, a loud
speaker, a sweet laugher.&nbsp; Then the nurse leaped up and fled when
she saw his wild face and bearded chin.&nbsp; But him did boon Hermes
straightway take in his hands and bear, and gladly did he rejoice at
heart.&nbsp; Swiftly to the dwellings of the Gods went he, bearing the
babe hidden in the thick skins of mountain hares; there sat he down
by Zeus and the other Immortals, and showed his child, and all the Immortals
were glad at heart, and chiefly the Bacchic Dionysus.&nbsp; Pan they
called the babe to name: because he had made glad the hearts of all
of them.&nbsp; Hail then to thee, O Prince, I am thy suppliant in song,
and I shall be mindful of thee and of another lay. <!-- page 233--><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span></p>
<h3>XIX.&nbsp; TO HEPH&AElig;STUS</h3>
<p>Sing, shrill Muse, of Heph&aelig;stus renowned in craft, who with
grey-eyed Athene taught goodly works to men on earth, even to men that
before were wont to dwell in mountain caves like beasts; but now, being
instructed in craft by the renowned craftsman Heph&aelig;stus, lightly
the whole year through they dwell happily in their own homes.&nbsp;
Be gracious, Heph&aelig;stus, and grant me valour and fortune. <!-- page 234--><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span></p>
<h3>XX.&nbsp; TO APOLLO</h3>
<p>Ph&oelig;bus, to thee the swan sings shrill to the beating of his
wings, as he lights on the bank of the whirling pools of the river Peneus;
and to thee with his shrill lyre does the sweet-voiced minstrel sing
ever, both first and last.&nbsp; Even so hail thou, Prince, I beseech
thee in my song. <!-- page 235--><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span></p>
<h3>XXI.&nbsp; TO POSEIDON</h3>
<p>Concerning Poseidon, a great God, I begin to sing: the shaker of
the land and of the sea unharvested; God of the deep who holdeth Helicon
and wide &AElig;g&aelig;.&nbsp; A double meed of honour have the Gods
given thee, O Shaker of the Earth, to be tamer of horses and saviour
of ships.&nbsp; Hail Prince, thou Girdler of the Earth, thou dark-haired
God, and with kindly heart, O blessed one, do thou befriend the mariners.
<!-- page 236--><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span></p>
<h3>XXII.&nbsp; TO HIGHEST ZEUS</h3>
<p>To Zeus the best of Gods will I sing; the best and the greatest,
the far-beholding lord who bringeth all to an end, who holdeth constant
counsel with Themis as she reclines on her couch.&nbsp; Be gracious,
far-beholding son of Cronos, thou most glorious and greatest. <!-- page 237--><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span></p>
<h3>XXIII.&nbsp; TO HESTIA</h3>
<p>Hestia, that guardest the sacred house of the Prince, Apollo the
Far-darter, in goodly Pytho, ever doth the oil drop dank from thy locks.&nbsp;
Come thou to this house with a gracious heart, come with counselling
Zeus, and lend grace to my song. <!-- page 238--><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span></p>
<h3>XXIV.&nbsp; TO THE MUSES AND APOLLO</h3>
<p>From the Muse I shall begin and from Apollo and Zeus.&nbsp; For it
is from the Muses and far-darting Apollo that minstrels and harpers
are upon the earth, but from Zeus come kings.&nbsp; Fortunate is he
whomsoever the Muses love, and sweet flows his voice from his lips.&nbsp;
Hail, ye children of Zeus, honour ye my lay, and anon I shall be mindful
of you and of another hymn. <!-- page 239--><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span></p>
<h3>XXV.&nbsp; TO DIONYSUS</h3>
<p>Of ivy-tressed uproarious Dionysus I begin to sing, the splendid
son of Zeus and renowned Semele.&nbsp; Him did the fair-tressed nymphs
foster, receiving him from the king and father in their bosoms, and
needfully they nurtured him in the glens of Nys&ecirc;.&nbsp; By his
father&rsquo;s will he waxed strong in the fragrant cavern, being numbered
among the Immortals.&nbsp; Anon when the Goddesses had bred him up to
be the god of many a hymn, then went he wandering in the woodland glades,
draped with ivy and laurel, and the nymphs followed with him where he
led, and loud rang the wild woodland.&nbsp; Hail to thee, then, Dionysus
of the clustered vine, and grant to us to come gladly again to the season
of vintaging, yea, and afterwards for many a year to come. <!-- page 240--><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span></p>
<h3>XXVI.&nbsp; TO ARTEMIS</h3>
<p>I sing of Artemis of the Golden Distaff, Goddess of the loud chase,
a maiden revered, the slayer of stags, the archer, very sister of Apollo
of the golden blade.&nbsp; She through the shadowy hills and the windy
headlands rejoicing in the chase draws her golden bow, sending forth
shafts of sorrow.&nbsp; Then tremble the crests of the lofty mountains,
and terribly the dark woodland rings with din of beasts, and the earth
shudders, and the teeming sea.&nbsp; Meanwhile she of the stout heart
turns about on every side slaying the race of wild beasts.&nbsp; Anon
when the Archer Huntress hath taken her delight, and hath gladdened
her heart, she slackens her bended bow, and goes to the great hall of
her dear Ph&oelig;bus Apollo, to the rich <!-- page 241--><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>Delphian
land; and arrays the lovely dance of Muses and Graces.&nbsp; There hangs
she up her bended bow and her arrows, and all graciously clad about
she leads the dances, first in place, while the others utter their immortal
voice in hymns to fair-ankled Leto, how she bore such children pre-eminent
among the Immortals in counsel and in deed.&nbsp; Hail, ye children
of Zeus and fair-tressed Leto, anon will I be mindful of you and of
another hymn. <!-- page 242--><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span></p>

</a></p>
<h3>XXVII.&nbsp; TO ATHENE</h3>
<p>Of fairest Athene, renowned Goddess, I begin to sing, of the Grey-eyed,
the wise; her of the relentless heart, the maiden revered, the succour
of cities, the strong Tritogeneia.&nbsp; Her did Zeus the counsellor
himself beget from his holy head, all armed for war in shining golden
mail, while in awe did the other Gods behold it.&nbsp; Quickly did the
Goddess leap from the immortal head, and stood before Zeus, shaking
her sharp spear, and high Olympus trembled in dread beneath the strength
of the grey-eyed Maiden, while earth rang terribly around, and the sea
was boiling with dark waves, and suddenly brake forth the foam.&nbsp;
Yea, and the glorious son of Hyperion checked for long his swift steeds,
till the maiden <!-- page 243--><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>took
from her immortal shoulders her divine armour, even Pallas Athene: and
Zeus the counsellor rejoiced.&nbsp; Hail to thee, thou child of &aelig;gis-bearing
Zeus, anon shall I be mindful of thee and of another lay. <!-- page 244--><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span></p>
<h3>XXVIII.&nbsp; TO HESTIA</h3>
<p>Hestia, thou that in the lofty halls of all immortal Gods, and of
all men that go on earth, hast obtained an eternal place and the foremost
honour, splendid is thy glory and thy gift, for there is no banquet
of mortals without thee, none where, Hestia, they be not wont first
and last to make to thee oblation of sweet wine.&nbsp; And do thou,
O slayer of Argus, son of Zeus and Maia, messenger of the blessed Gods,
God of the golden wand, Giver of all things good, do thou with Hestia
dwell in the fair mansions, dear each to other; with kindly heart befriend
us in company with dear and honoured Hestia.&nbsp; [For both the twain,
well skilled in <!-- page 245--><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>all
fair works of earthly men, consort with wisdom and youth.]&nbsp; Hail
daughter of Cronos, thou and Hermes of the golden wand, anon will I
be mindful of you and of another lay. <!-- page 246--><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span></p>
<h3>XXIX.&nbsp; TO EARTH, THE MOTHER OF ALL</h3>
<p>Concerning Earth, the mother of all, shall I sing, firm Earth, eldest
of Gods, that nourishes all things in the world; all things that fare
on the sacred land, all things in the sea, all flying things, all are
fed out of her store.&nbsp; Through thee, revered Goddess, are men happy
in their children and fortunate in their harvest.&nbsp; Thine it is
to give or to take life from mortal men.&nbsp; Happy is he whom thou
honourest with favouring heart; to him all good things are present innumerable:
his fertile field is laden, his meadows are rich in cattle, his house
filled with all good things.&nbsp; Such men rule righteously in cities
of fair women, great wealth and riches are theirs, their children grow
glorious in <!-- page 247--><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>fresh
delights: their maidens joyfully dance and sport through the soft meadow
flowers in floral revelry.&nbsp; Such are those that thou honourest,
holy Goddess, kindly spirit.&nbsp; Hail, Mother of the Gods, thou wife
of starry Ouranos, and freely in return for my ode give me sufficient
livelihood.&nbsp; Anon will I be mindful of thee and of another lay.
<!-- page 248--><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span></p>
<h3>XXX.&nbsp; TO HELIOS</h3>
<p>Begin, O Muse Calliope, to sing of Helios the child of Zeus, the
splendid Helios whom dark-eyed Euryph&aelig;ssa bore to the son of Earth
and starry Heaven.&nbsp; For Hyperion wedded Euryph&aelig;ssa, his own
sister, who bore him goodly children, the rosy-armed Dawn, and fair-tressed
Selene, and the tireless Helios, like unto the Immortals, who from his
chariot shines on mortals and on deathless Gods, and dread is the glance
of his eyes from his golden helm, and bright rays shine forth from him
splendidly, and round his temples the shining locks flowing down from
his head frame round his far-seen face, and a goodly garment wrought
delicately shines about his body in the breath of the winds, and <!-- page 249--><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>stallions
speed beneath him when he, charioting his horses and golden-yoked car,
drives down through heaven to ocean.&nbsp; Hail, Prince, and of thy
grace grant me livelihood enough; beginning from thee I shall sing the
race of heroes half divine, whose deeds the Goddesses have revealed
to mortals. <!-- page 250--><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span></p>
<h3>XXXI.&nbsp; TO THE MOON</h3>
<p>Ye Muses, sing of the fair-faced, wide-winged Moon; ye sweet-voiced
daughters of Zeus son of Cronos, accomplished in song!&nbsp; The heavenly
gleam from her immortal head circles the earth, and all beauty arises
under her glowing light, and the lampless air beams from her golden
crown, and the rays dwell lingering when she has bathed her fair body
in the ocean stream, and clad her in shining raiment, divine Selene,
yoking her strong-necked glittering steeds.&nbsp; Then forward with
speed she drives her deep-maned horses in the evening of the mid-month
when her mighty orb is full; then her beams are brightest in the sky
as she waxes, a token and a signal to mortal men.&nbsp; With her once
was <!-- page 251--><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>Cronion wedded
in love, and she conceived, and brought forth Pandia the maiden, pre-eminent
in beauty among the immortal Gods.&nbsp; Hail, Queen, white-armed Goddess,
divine Selene, gentle of heart and fair of tress.&nbsp; Beginning from
thee shall I sing the renown of heroes half divine whose deeds do minstrels
chant from their charmed lips; these ministers of the Muses. <!-- page 252--><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span></p>
<h3>XXXII.&nbsp; TO THE DIOSCOURI</h3>
<p>Sing, fair-glancing Muses, of the sons of Zeus, the Tyndarid&aelig;,
glorious children of fair-ankled Leda, Castor the tamer of steeds and
faultless Polydeuces.&nbsp; These, after wedlock with Cronion of the
dark clouds, she bore beneath the crests of Taygetus, that mighty hill,
to be the saviours of earthly men, and of swift ships when the wintry
breezes rush along the pitiless sea.&nbsp; Then men from their ships
call in prayer with sacrifice of white lambs when they mount the vessel&rsquo;s
deck.&nbsp; But the strong wind and the wave of the sea drive down their
ship beneath the water; when suddenly appear the sons of Zeus rushing
through the air with tawny wings, and straightway have they stilled
the tempests of <!-- page 253--><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>evil
winds, and have lulled the waves in the gulfs of the white salt sea:
glad signs are they to mariners, an ending of their labour: and men
see it and are glad, and cease from weary toil.&nbsp; Hail ye, Tyndarid&aelig;,
ye knights of swift steeds, anon will I be mindful of you and of another
lay. <!-- page 254--><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<h3>XXXIII.&nbsp; TO DIONYSUS</h3>
<p>Some say that Semele bare thee to Zeus the lord of thunder in Dracanon,
and some in windy Icarus, and some in Naxos, thou seed of Zeus, Eiraphiotes;
and others by the deep-swelling river Alpheius, and others, O Prince,
say that thou wert born in Thebes.&nbsp; Falsely speak they all: for
the Father of Gods and men begat thee far away from men, while white-armed
Hera knew it not.&nbsp; There is a hill called Nys&ecirc;, a lofty hill,
flowering into woodland, far away from Ph&oelig;nicia, near the streams
of &AElig;gyptus. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to thee will they raise many statues in the temples: as
these thy deeds are three, so men will sacrifice to thee hecatombs every
three years.&rdquo; <a name="citation254"></a><a href="#footnote254">{254}</a>
<!-- page 255--><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span></p>
<p>So spake Zeus the counsellor, and nodded with his head.&nbsp; Be
gracious, Eiraphiotes, thou wild lover, from thee, beginning and ending
with thee, we minstrels sing: in nowise is it possible for him who forgets
thee to be mindful of sacred song.&nbsp; Hail to thee, Dionysus Eiraphiotes,
with thy mother Semele, whom men call Thyone.</p>

In our illustration both the lyre with a tortoise shell for sounding-board,
and the cithara, with no such sounding-board, are represented.&nbsp;
Is it possible that &ldquo;the tuneful shell&rdquo; was primarily used
<i>without</i> chords, as an instrument for drumming upon?&nbsp; The
drum, variously made, is the primitive musical instrument, and it is
doubted whether any stringed instrument existed among native American
races.&nbsp; But drawings in ancient Aztec MSS. (as Mr. Morse has recently
observed) show the musician using a kind of drum made of a tortoise-shell,
and some students have (probably with too much fancy) recognised a figure
with a tortoise-shell fitted with chords, in Aztec MSS.&nbsp; It is
possible enough that the early Greeks used the shell as a sort of drum,
before some inventor (Hermes, in the Hymn) added chords and developed
a stringed instrument.&nbsp; <i>Cf</i>. p. 39.</p>

The passage which follows (409-414) is too corrupt to admit of any but
conjectural rendering.&nbsp; Probably Apollo twisted bands, which fell
off Hermes, turned to growing willows, and made a bower over the kine.&nbsp;
See Mr. Allen, <i>op. cit</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote162a"></a><a href="#citation162a">{162a}</a>&nbsp;

There seems to be a reference to the <i>caduceus</i> of Hermes, which
some have compared to the forked Divining Rod.&nbsp; The whole is corrupt
and obscure.&nbsp; To myself it seems that, when he gave the lyre (463-495),
Hermes was hinting at his wish to receive in exchange the gift of prophecy.&nbsp;
If so, these passages are all disjointed, and 521, with what follows,
should come after 495, where Hermes makes the gift of the lyre.</p>
<p><a name="footnote164"></a><a href="#citation164">{164}</a>&nbsp;
It appears from Philochorus that the prophetic lots were called <i>thri&aelig;</i>.&nbsp;

youngest son or daughter,&rdquo; in Kent.&nbsp; See &ldquo;Costumal

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
